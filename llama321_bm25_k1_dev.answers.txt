Based on the provided documents, it appears that the ancient Roman marble statue "Venus Callipyge" (also known as the Aphrodite Kallipygos) or "Callipygian Venus" represents Venus/Aphrodite of the beautiful buttocks.  The document mentions that the original Greek statue is thought to have been bronze and executed around 300 BC, near the beginning of the Hellenistic era. The marble version's sculptor and provenance are unknown, but it was rediscovered in Rome by at least the 16th century and was acquired by the Farnese family.  The restored head of the statue in Naples, which looks back over her shoulder to emphasize her bare buttocks, is attributed to Carlo Albacini. This restoration decision greatly affected subsequent interpretations and has been described as having "created a 'masterpiece' in place of a fragment" by classicists Mary Beard and J. G. W. Henderson.  The document also mentions that the statue was later copied several times, including a marble copy by Jean-Jacques Clerion (1686) sent to Versailles, another copy made by Francois Barois during his residence at the French Academy in Rome (1683-86), and an Augustus the Strong ordered a copy for the Grosser Garten, Dresden.  Overall, the documents suggest that "Venus Callipyge" is primarily represented by its female nudity, particularly its depiction of Venus/Aphrodite's beautiful buttocks.

The process of decreasing or eliminating an unwanted magnetic field, known as degaussing, was first used by Commander Charles F. Goodeve, RCNVR, during World War II to counter the effects of German magnetic mines on British ships. He developed systems to induce a small "N-pole up" field into the ships to offset this effect.  The original method of degaussing involved installing electromagnetic coils (coiling) into the ship's hulls, which induced a bias field that could be reversed in the southern hemisphere where the mines were set to detect "S-pole down" fields. This process was known as "wiping" and was not very effective.  Later, an alternative method called "degaussing with wiping" (also devised by Goodeve) used a large electrical cable dragged along the side of the ship with about 2000 amps flowing through it to induce a bias field into the ship. This process was originally thought to be effective in randomizing the field's oscillation, but a more serious problem was later realized: as a ship travels through the Earth's magnetic field, it will slowly pick up that field, counteracting the effects of degaussing.  To avoid this problem, captains were instructed to change direction as often as possible when navigating. The bias field also wore off over time, and ships had to be degaussed on a schedule. Modern systems have improved upon these methods by detecting changes in the magnetic field rather than the field itself, which means that a ship with a "magnetic hot spot" will still set off mines.  Today, degaussing is mainly used for magnetic storage media such as hard drives and floppy disks.

I think there may be a small mistake in your question.  In rugby union, each team has 2 flanks (or props) and 2 locks (or hookers). The two flankers are usually the second and third players on each side of the scrum. So, for each team, there are 4 players on one side of the scrum, which means there are:  * 1 prop * 1 lock  So, if you add up the number shirts of the two flanks in rugby union, it would be: 2 (first flanker) + 2 (second flanker) + 1 (lock) = 5 shirts.  Please let me know if I'm correct or if there's anything else I can help with!

In American English, a waistcoat is more commonly referred to as a vest. This can be confusing for those from the United Kingdom (UK), where the term "vest" typically refers to a sleeveless undershirt or a piece of clothing worn over a shirt.  The author notes that in UK-speaking regions, a "waistcoat" might refer specifically to an older type of waistcoat called a "doublet", which had many openings and was elaborate. Over time, the meaning of "vest" shifted, and it is now more commonly used to describe sleeveless garments worn over shirts.  In contrast, in American English, especially in informal contexts, "waistcoat" might be used interchangeably with "shirt" or simply as a term for any piece of clothing that covers the upper body. However, when referring to formal wear, particularly from the UK's past, an American would more likely refer to it as a vest.

Based on the definitions provided by The Free Dictionary, here are some creatures that may be bred and reared in a 'ranarium':  1. Domestic animals: This could include cattle, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, birds (such as chickens or ducks), and other domesticated species. 2. Plants: Depending on the context, plants such as vegetables, fruits, herbs, and flowers may also be bred and reared in a 'ranarium'. 3. Fish: If mentioned in the original document, fish may be part of the list.  However, it's essential to note that a 'ranarium' typically refers to an enclosure or habitat designed for the care and breeding of exotic animals. So, it is unlikely to find creatures like bears, wolves, lions, or other large carnivores in this context.  In general, creatures that may be bred and reared in a 'ranarium' include:  * Domesticated mammals (e.g., cows, pigs, chickens) * Exotic birds (e.g., parrots, ostriches, flamingos) * Fish (e.g., goldfish, tropical fish) * Reptiles or amphibians (e.g., lizards, turtles, frogs)  Keep in mind that these are general possibilities and the specific creatures mentioned in the original document may not necessarily fit this description.

I think there might be some confusion or miscommunication here. The question doesn't seem to refer to a specific topic or context, but rather appears to be a collection of examples from various sources (books, manga, anime, comics, and games) that showcase the humorous side of fashion items.  If I had to make an educated guess, I'd say the answer might be related to "clothing" itself, given the context. Am I correct in assuming you're asking for a general example of something a grabologist (perhaps a person who collects and hoards clothing) would find fascinating or entertaining?

The correct answer is:  1. Head 2. Body 3. Extremities (arms and legs)  Jugular veins are one of the major blood vessels in the neck that play a crucial role in draining deoxygenated blood back to the heart.  * The two jugular veins, which are located on either side of the base of the skull, open into the internal jugular vein. * From there, the blood is carried by the subclavian veins and then empties into the superior vena cava (SVC), a major vein that carries deoxygenated blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.  It's worth noting that while jugular veins are involved in carrying blood away from the head, other venous structures, such as the inferior vena cava and the pulmonary veins, carry deoxygenated blood from the body back to the heart.

The answer to the question "Which Australian city has a cricket ground called The Oval" depends on the context of the question. If we are referring to the Adelaide Oval, which is located in South Australia and is one of the most iconic cricket grounds in the world, then the correct answer remains unchanged.  However, if we consider other cities with a similar name or context, it might be possible for another city to have a stadium called The Oval. For example:  * In New Zealand, there are two cricket grounds named The Oval, one in Christchurch and the other in Auckland. * In England, there is also an oval-shaped field at Manchester Cricket Ground (formerly known as Old Trafford), but it's not commonly referred to as "The Oval".  But if we consider a city without a stadium with this name, then Adelaide Oval would be the only Australian city that has a cricket ground called The Oval.

Pollyanna is a story about a kind-hearted orphan girl who spreads joy and positivity wherever she goes, while Little Lord Fauntleroy is a book about an orphaned boy who melts the hearts of those around him with his generosity and love for his family.  Therefore, based on this information, it can be deduced that Eleanor H. Porter created the character of Pollyanna in two books.

The document does not explicitly state the number of EU member states as of 2012. However, based on the information provided in the documents, we can infer that at least 28 EU Member States existed between 2012 and 2015.  Additionally, the documents mention several EU countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Sweden) that joined the euro before 2015. Therefore, it is likely that as many as 30-31 EU Member States existed by 2015, assuming some countries had already adopted the common currency and not all still had their own currency.  Please note that this estimate may be speculative, and I've made an educated guess based on the available information.

Based on the provided text and study questions about Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, I believe the Shakespeare play that could be summarised as "The magician Prospero shipwrecks the enemies that originally ousted him from Italy, but when Ferdinand falls for his daughter Miranda he finally faces them down and learns to forgive" is actually "A Midsummer Night's Dream".  However, considering the context of Brave New World and the themes of imperialism, colonization, and the relationship between humans and technology, a more suitable answer might be "The Tempest". The play explores the theme of colonialism, as Prospero, an English exile, seeks to reclaim his place in Italy, while also confronting the native inhabitants and their leader, Caliban.

The correct answer is not explicitly stated in the provided text, but based on my knowledge of stamps from the UK and their design elements, I can make an educated guess.  Sir Basil Spence was a British architect known for his modernist and minimalist designs. His buildings often featured simple, clean lines, and minimal ornamentation.  Given this information, it is likely that the building designed by Sir Basil Spence which appeared on a stamp issued in February would be one of his notable works or a building from the 1950s.  Some possibilities could include:  1. The University of London (Birkbeck) - Designed in 1958, its buildings feature a distinctive, modernist style. 2. Leicester City Council's St James' Church - Designed by Sir Basil Spence and completed in 1964-65, it is a prominent example of the architect's work. 3. The University College London's Westfield House - Another notable building from Spence's portfolio.  Without more specific information about the stamp or the date, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact building designed by Sir Basil Spence that appeared on a UK postage stamp issued in February.

If someone is dismissed from their job, they are typically given a severance package or notice period. The length of the notice period varies depending on the company and the reason for termination.  In the UK, most employees are entitled to a statutory minimum notice period of at least 2 weeks under the Employment Rights Act 1996, but this can be longer in cases where there is a serious breach of contract or misconduct by the employee.

In other words, "bad money" (i.e. inferior or unattractive money) can erode consumer spending power and reduce the incentive for producers to innovate or improve their products and services.

However, not all critics agree with this view. Some have raised concerns about the potential risks of transmitting deliberate messages from Earth, which they consider to be too speculative or even panicky. They argue that such transmissions could potentially harm an alien civilization if it is unaware of their presence.
