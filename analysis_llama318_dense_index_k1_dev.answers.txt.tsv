Kardashian and Sarkisian are examples of common surnames from what language?	The answer is English. Kardashian and Sarkisian are both well-known surnames that originated in the English language.  * Kardashian is an Armenian-American surname, but it has been adopted into the English language. * Sarkisian is also of Armenian origin and has been adopted into the English language.  However, based on the text, we can also infer that Kardashian and Sarkisian are examples of surnames with endings similar to those found in Armenian and other non-English languages. In Armenian, for example, many surnames end with the suffixes "-yan" or "-ian", which is also seen in the case of Kardashian (which ends with "-ian") and possibly Sarkisian, although the specific ending here is not specified.	հայ	armenian disambiguation	Հայաստանցի	ARmenian	Armenian (disambiguation)	Armenian	Հայ	armenian	հայաստանցի	True

The name of what literary swashbuckler is the answer to the final question in the Oscar winning Slumdog Millionaire?	This question has nothing to do with the provided documents about the Pulitzer Prizes. The answer to your question is "Benjamin Button" is not correct, but it's not mentioned in any of the given texts either. However, I can provide you with the actual answer.  The literary swashbuckler being referred to is likely Richard Branson, no... That would be incorrect as well...  However if we look at Slumdog Millionaire, we know that one of the final questions in the quiz show was indeed about a character from literature. And that question was actually "Who is the author of the famous novel 'Sawdust and Tinsel'?" However I believe the actual answer to this last question is not related to any literary swashbuckler, nor the Oscar winning film Slumdog Millionaire.  The name of the correct character or book being referred to here, in that quiz scene in the movie, isn't a "literary swashbuckler" but rather it's a character from a novel. The final question is indeed about a very famous and important character from literature.	Aramis	aramis	False

The question does not match the provided text. The text is about fairs and markets, their history, laws, and regulations.  However, I can provide an answer based on general knowledge:  A traditional term that might refer to the difference between a price paid for a company or business, and the actual (lower) 'book value' of its assets, is "acquisition discount" but more commonly known as "goodwill".  Goodwill was often written off in the books, creating a discrepancy between the amount paid for an asset (usually cash) and its book value.

"The islands Santa Ysabel, Choiseul, Guadalcanal, Malaita and San Cristbal are in which group?"	The islands you listed (Santa Ysabel, Choiseul, Guadalcanal, Malaita) are all located in the Solomon Islands. However, I couldn't find any information on an island called "San Cristbal".

"In the 1950s, which country on the east coast of the Bay of Bengal was bordered by Pakistan, India, Tibet, China, French Indo China and Siam?"	The question doesn't specify a particular decade or time period, but based on the countries mentioned (Pakistan, India, Tibet, China, French Indo-China, and Siam), I would suggest that the answer is Bangladesh.  In 1950s, East Pakistan was a part of Pakistan. However, considering other parts of the region, it seems like you might be referring to the geographical area now known as Bangladesh.  Here's why: - The country was indeed bordered by India, Tibet (as part of China), and Siam (now Thailand). - French Indo-China referred to present-day Vietnam. - So, putting all these pieces together, it is likely that the question is referring to East Pakistan at that time.	ပြည်ထောင်စု သမ္မတ မြန်မာနိုင်ငံတော	myanmar formerly burma	Burma (Myanmar)	Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma	myanmer	မြန်မာပြည်	mayanmar	Birman Empire	birmanie	Myanma	burma myanmar	Economic sanctions against Burma	mianmar	Myammar	Myanmar	birmania	pyidaunzu thanmăda myăma nainngandaw	union of myanmar	Etymology of Burma	Borders of Burma	Burma/Myanmar	economic sanctions against burma	Myanmer	Economic sanctions against Myanmar	Pyidaunzu Thanmăda Myăma Nainngandaw	Mayanmar	Myanmar/Burma	Eastern Burma	etymology of burma	socialist republic of union of burma	Myanmar (Burma)	Union of Myanmar	Mianmar	myammar	republic of union of myanmar	myanmar	pyi daung zu myan ma naing ngan daw	Union of burma	Burma-Myanmar	burmese republic	economic sanctions against myanmar	sanctions against burma	union of burma	ပြည်ထောင်စု သမ္မတ မြန်မာနိုင်ငံတော်	Burmese Republic	iso 3166 1 mm	Birma	myanma	birma	Birmania	Birmanie	ISO 3166-1:MM	Republic of the Union of Myanmar	borders of burma	Sanctions against Burma	Myanmar (formerly Burma)	birman empire	Pyi-daung-zu Myan-ma Naing-ngan-daw	myanmar burma	Myanmar/(Burma)	Burma	eastern burma	burma	Republic of The Union of Myanmar	False
