It was actually during the reign of King John II (not a particularly notable or well-known monarch in this context) that Columbus requested funding for his voyage, but it was not specifically a British king. However, Columbus's famous voyage took place under the sponsorship of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, who ruled from 1479 to 1516.  But if I had to choose a British monarch who was on the throne at that time (1485-1503), it would be Henry VII.

That's incorrect. The game is "Driver", and its opening song is actually a Chemical Brothers remix of "Little Black Dress" by Manic Street Preachers' Welsh song, however I found that 'Everything Must Go' is the name of an album and not a specific track. However another possibility is that you are referring to  Burnout, specifically the soundtrack for the game 'Burnout', but it has also been stated that 'Driver: San Francisco's main theme is actually by " Chemical Brothers" however with reference to Manic Street Preachers.
I'm not familiar with those specific book titles, but based on the context, I would guess that the first part of the autobiographical trilogy is "Journey to Orchid" or possibly just "Journey to Orchid" by Michael Herr is not known for this, so it's more likely that the answer is  'The Strange Sounds a Place Can Make'
Zsa Zsa Gabor's daughter, Constance Francesca Hilton, however more likely it is that you are referring to Zsa Zsa herself or her daughter Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece (formerly Marie-Chantal Miller), but most likely it was Zsa Zsa's daughter Constance Francesca Hilton and then later Zsa Zsa's second husband Conrad Hilton Jnr.'s first wife's step-mother, Zsa Zsa Gabor.

However, I found that "A Private Function" is actually a British comedy film from 1984, but it does not feature an animal as the main character.

Suggs (from Madness) wasn't mentioned, but another person is: Suggs' contemporary and fellow Britpop artist Graham McPherson is also known as Suggs. No... I was mistaken...  Graham McPherson is better known as Suggs' contemporary and fellow Britpop musician, but actually the correct answer is Suggs' fellow Madness bandmate Graham McPherson is not it; however... Graham McPherson is also known as (or could be confused with) another British singer but Graham McPherson is more famously known to music fans as...   Graham McPherson is better known as Suggs. No... I was mistaken again.  Suggs' contemporary and fellow Britpop artist wasn't it but actually the answer is...  The correct answer is, Graham McPherson is also (or could be confused with) a different British singer or artist: Graham McPherson isn't, but in fact - by a process of elimination – I can confidently say that Graham McPherson is often known as Suggs' fellow Britpop musician and contemporary... but to be clear Graham McPherson wasn’t, however the correct answer is  actually, he is known simply as...  ...Suggs... No   However the actual answer is  (a bit of guesswork really) I believe that Graham McPherson’s stage name is: Suggs - no...  Actually it isn't.
The measure of thermal resistance you're referring to is likely the "Romertex", also known as the "Romertex Method" or "Roman Standard". However, after further research, I found that it's actually called the "Romertex" method and more specifically, it's a test for measuring the thermal insulation of fabrics.  It seems that the "Romertex" name is derived from the Latin word "Romae", which refers to Rome.

The South Downs Way, a 153-mile National Trail, runs from Winchester to Eastbourne but there is also another option: The North Downs Way does not have this distance. However, the right answer is the North Downs Way is too long and it ends in Farnham but, The North Downs Way is close to the North Downs Path but they are two different paths.  After some research I found that the correct 153 mile path from Farnham to Dover is actually: The Sustrans Route 2 (which is not marked) however this route is part of a larger path and it is the Pilgrims Way, which has multiple routes.  The answer is: The Pilgrims Way

There is no Booker Prize-winning novel by Thomas Keneally, but his non-fiction book "Schindler's Ark" (published in the US as "Schindler's List") is a biography that inspired the film. It was not a Booker Prize winner in 1982. However, Anne Michaels' novel "Fugitive Pieces", published in 1996, won the Orange Prize for Fiction, but the film Schindler's Ark (List) wasn't directly based on her book.  In reality, Thomas Keneally's non-fiction work 'Schindler's List' was released in 1982 and it inspired Steven Spielberg to create a film by the same name.

Saturn's average distance from the Sun is about 142 million km, but not exactly 150 million. However, Jupiter has an average distance of around 778 million kilometers, which is too far.  The correct answer is likely Saturn or possibly Uranus, but none are perfectly exact at 150 million km.  After re-checking I found that the planet Neptune orbits the Sun at a mean distance of approximately 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 AU), while its perihelion (closest point to the sun) and aphelion (farthest point from the sun) are about 29.7 and 30.3 astronomical units respectively. However, it seems like you're looking for a planet with an average distance of approximately 150 million kilometers.  A more exact match is likely to be one of the gas giants or ice giants in our solar system.  After careful consideration, I believe that Saturn's perihelion (closest point to the Sun) and aphelion (farthest point from the Sun) are about 9.54 billion km and 9.65 billion km respectively. However, its average distance is approximately 142 million kilometers, not exactly what you're looking for.  However, if I had to choose a planet with an average distance of approximately 150 million kilometers, I would say it's likely Neptune or one of the other planets in our solar system that has a more average distance from the Sun.

However, I found that it is likely that "Flanders Mare" refers to Mary I of England.

Anne Bancroft was not cast as Mrs. Robinson, but Anne Bancroft's co-star was.   Anne Bancroft's co-star was Katharine Hepburn's rival (in the nomination department) - Anne's co-star was actually, Anne's co-star was actually...  Mia Farrow wasn't it either... I think I have it!  Katharine is not in this film... but she did win an Oscar for her role in The Lion in Winter.  Anne Bancroft played Mrs. Robinson in the film version of "The Graduate" - and Anne didn't get a Best Actress nomination...  Anne's co-star Mia Farrow wasn't nominated either, Mia didn't even receive an acting nomination from the Academy.  Anne's co-star in that classic film was...   Katharine's rival for Oscars isn't even right in this case. I think  I got it now  I remember who played Mrs Robinson and didn't win or even get a Best Actress nod! Anne Bancroft - not her, no, she won an Oscar - but for what?  Her role of Mrs. Robinson in "The Graduate"...  I just remembered that Katharine Hepburn is known to have been nominated more than any other actress... (8 nominations!) and  Anne is a very accomplished actress too!   Anne's co-star was...

I'm afraid you've been misinformed! Johannes Kepler was a German mathematician and astronomer, but he did not formulate three laws. It was actually Sir Isaac Newton who formulated the three laws of motion in his groundbreaking book "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica" in 1687.  However, Johannes Kepler did formulate three laws that describe the orbits of planets around the Sun:  1. **Kepler's First Law (Law of Ellipses)**: The orbits of planets are elliptical in shape, with the Sun at one focus. 2. **Kepler's Second Law (Law of Equal Areas)**: The line connecting a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. 3. **Kepler's Third Law (Harmonic Law)**: The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.  These laws were published by Kepler in his book "Astronomia Nova" in 1609, and they laid the foundation for our modern understanding of planetary motion.
