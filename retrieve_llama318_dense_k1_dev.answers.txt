The answer is: **Queen Elizabeth II**  Explanation:  * "Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea" was a title used by Scottish monarchs. * "Conqueror of the British Empire" refers to the expansion of the British Empire during the reign of Queen Victoria, but Queen Elizabeth II's predecessors held similar titles. * The "Last King of Scotland" is a reference to Charles Edward Stuart, also known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, who was the last king of Scotland. However, more recently, Queen Elizabeth II was the monarch who oversaw the devolution of power to Scotland and the establishment of the Scottish Parliament.  However, considering these titles are associated with historical figures, I would say the most likely answer is:  **Queen Victoria**  She held the title "Empress of India" (also known as "Conqueror of the British Empire") from 1876 until 1901.
