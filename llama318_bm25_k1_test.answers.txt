Based on the text, the correct answer is:  **Ronald Reagan** (1981-1989) and **George H.W. Bush** (1989-1993)  This can be inferred from the fact that Executive Order 12333, which listed the members of the Intelligence Community, was issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, and there is no mention of a subsequent executive order on intelligence during this period.  It appears that Richard Nixon's administration had ended in 1974, Jimmy Carter served as President from 1977 to 1981, and Gerald Ford was not mentioned.

The correct answer is: True.  The last words spoken in the play are "I'll ne'er go, nor the Queen's in this regard," spoken by Lady Macduff. However, it appears that there might be a slight mistake in the options provided, as I could not verify that Lady Macduff speaks the very last line of the play.  However, according to the script, the actual final words are indeed "I'll ne'er go" by Young Siward and then the title character Macbeth is killed, but it's followed by:  "Come what come may, Time and the hour runs through the roughest day. MACBETH Lay on, Macduff; and damned be him that first cries 'Hold, enough!' For life's but a walking shadow; a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing."  So it seems like I made some mistake in interpreting your question, but if you meant which character speaks those very last lines, then indeed Macbeth is the one who speaks them.

The answer to the question is:  Procurator Fiscal (PF)  This is a true statement. In Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal is responsible for investigating sudden and suspicious deaths, conducting fatal accident enquiries, and acting as the public prosecutor in such cases.  Now, regarding the original text you provided, it appears to be a collection of comments and opinions from individuals discussing the case of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was killed by police officers in London in 2005. The comments express a range of views on the incident, including outrage, disappointment, and skepticism about the official investigations and the lack of accountability for those involved.  Some common themes that emerge from the text include:  * Criticism of the police's handling of the operation, particularly their failure to identify de Menezes as a suspect and their use of excessive force * Outrage at the manipulation of photographic evidence and the lies told by police officers about the events surrounding de Menezes' death * Disappointment that no one was held accountable for the killing * Skepticism about the official investigations, including the conclusion that de Menezes' death was an "open verdict" * Concerns about the implications of this case for policing and accountability in the UK  Overall, the text provides a window into the public's reaction to this high-profile incident and raises important questions about police accountability, transparency, and the use of force.

However, according to my research, in 2013, the Catholic Church (Vatican) was found to have investments exceeding £650 million from "recognition" payments received in 1929 from Benito Mussolini.   Therefore, a more accurate question would be: True or False: The global-reaching organization revealed in 2013 to hold property investments exceeding £½bn derived from 'recognition' payments received in 1929 from Benito Mussolini is the Catholic Church (Vatican).  This makes the answer FALSE because £650 million exceeds £½bn.

Since there is no direct information about which specific land-locked European country has achieved this feat, I'll provide an answer based on general knowledge.  Italy is known for its strong teams in water polo and fencing. While it has not held the Winter Olympics (Torino 2006 was the first time), Italy has hosted several other international events, including the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.  However, considering that we are discussing a land-locked European country that "never" hosted the Olympics, I'll look for another possibility.  Hungary is another strong contender, with successful teams in water polo and fencing. While Hungary has not hosted the Summer Olympics since 1896 (Budapest), it did host the 1952 Summer Olympics were awarded to Helsinki, Finland instead.  Therefore, considering general knowledge about these countries' achievements in sports and past hosting events, I'd say:  The statement is "TRUE" for Hungary.

However, if you're looking for the answer based on the information provided in the text up to a certain point (for example, before June 2014), then according to the timeline:  The U.S. Supreme Court granted Utah's request for a delay in recognizing same-sex marriages performed in late 2013 and early 2014.  On **October 6, 2014**, same-sex marriage became legal in Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.  So, among these states (which were the first to be mentioned as having legalized same-sex marriage), we can conclude that:  **Utah was not the first state.**  However, it's worth noting that Utah is not the first state to legalize same-sex marriage according to general knowledge.

This question does not match any of the provided text. However, I can try to answer it based on general knowledge.  The family that fits this description is the Herschel family. Specifically:  * William Herschel (1738-1822) discovered Uranus in 1781. * John Herschel (1792-1871), son of William, compiled a star catalogue, mapped all the stars in the Northern hemisphere, and founded an observatory to map those in the Southern.  So, the correct answer is: True.
