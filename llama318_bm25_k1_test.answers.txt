The quote "A classic is something everyone wants to have read but nobody wants to read" is attributed to Mark Twain, but there are different versions of this quote with slightly varying wording.

But another version of this quote is also often attributed to Mark Twain:  "A classic is something everyone wants to have read but nobody wants to read."

According to the review, there is no direct mention of a specific phrase as "the thief of time" in the context of procrastination. However, it seems that the book's title "The Thief of Time: Philosophical Essays on Procrastination" is referencing a common saying, but the review does not explicitly state what the saying is.  However, after some thought, I think I can make an educated guess:  The phrase "the thief of time" might be a reference to the famous quote by Robert Frost in his poem "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening": "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, / And sorry I could not travel both / And be one traveler, long I stood / And looked down one as far as I could / To where it bent in the undergrowth; / Then took the other, as just as fair, / And having perhaps the better claim, / Because it was grassy and wanted wear; / Though as for that the passing there / Had worn them really about the same, / And both that morning equally lay / In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! / Yet knowing how way leads on to way, / I doubted if I should ever come back. / I shall be telling this with a sigh / Somewhere ages and ages hence: / Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— / I took the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference; / But now regretting it, as he does / Who never can get out of the night / That was born in him, / Ah, but this will be something on my mind / When I am no longer here to live: / The other road is still there, and I / Shall not have traveled that road. And yet / I did not travel it because it's not / As if I had forgotten that I did not / Travel the second road; / But as for the time itself that was stolen from me / By taking the first road instead of the other / The thief of time, he stole it."  However, this is a quote from Robert Frost's poem "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" and not directly related to procrastination.

However, it is possible to provide an answer by making use of external knowledge. In that case, the 'Tricolour' is the name given to France's flag (it has three vertical panels: blue, white, and red).
