Therefore, in terms of land borders within the US, there are actually three states that don't share a border with any other state:   1. Alaska  2. Hawaii 3. Maine	2	two	True

However, if we look at the information about Series One - The Black Adder in the document provided, it states that 'King Richard IV' was played by Brian Blessed. It does not mention a character called Richard III being played by anyone in this series.  It's worth noting that the first series is set during the reign of King Richard III and his son, King Richard IV, which might have caused some confusion between these two characters.

What is considered the most successful (financially and most other ways) Australian film of the 1980's?	Unfortunately, I don't see any documents related to films or the Australian film industry. However, based on my general knowledge, I can provide an answer.  The most successful Australian film of the 1980s is often considered to be "Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior" (also known as "Mad Max 2") directed by George Miller and released in 1981. It was a critical and commercial success, both locally and internationally, grossing over $45 million at the box office.  However, if I had to choose another option based on its financial performance, I would suggest "Crocodile Dundee" (1986), which became a global phenomenon and grossed over $326 million worldwide.
