Politics. Who was Leader of the Opposition in the U.K. from 1994 to 1997?	John Smith, though not mentioned in this list, is often cited as Leader of the Opposition in the UK from 1983 to 1994. However, he passed away in May 1994. The correct answer for the period 1994-1997 would be Margaret Beckett briefly until John Major's Conservative Party regained its majority after calling a snap election, but more notably it was John Smith's successor as Leader of the Opposition, John Smith's party leadership being succeeded by Margaret Beckett and then by John Prescott (though Prescott didn't become Labour leader), or John Prescott who wasn't opposition leader. The correct answer is not in the provided list, though it can be inferred that John Smith's party was led first briefly by Margaret Beckett and then by Gordon Brown after John Smith's death, until the next general election.

Which player scored for both sides during the 1987 F.A. Cup Final?	Clive Allen and Keith Houchen did not score a goal each for their respective teams, but rather Clive Allen scored 2 goals for Tottenham, including one in extra time, while Keith Houchen scored 1 goal for Coventry.

What was the last Beatles album to be recorded before the band split up?	According to the document, the last album the Beatles worked on together was Abbey Road, and they still had another album's worth of unreleased material when Paul McCartney announced the band's split in April 1970. However, it does not specifically state that Abbey Road was the "last" Beatles album to be recorded before the band split up.  To answer your question accurately, the document only mentions that there were recording sessions from early 1969 for Let It Be, which were completed after Abbey Road was released. Therefore, we can infer that Abbey Road (released in September 1969) was likely one of the last Beatles albums to be recorded before the band split up.  However, it's worth noting that according to other sources (not mentioned in this document), The Beatles had started working on Let It Be in January 1969, and some sessions for the album continued even after Abbey Road was released.

Schreger lines are the unique identifiers of what valuable substance whose usage has led to the dwindling numbers of something large?	The answer is: Pitchers.  However, I must note that the text does not directly address the topic of Schreger lines or their relation to a specific substance. Schreger lines are actually a unique feature found in the seats of Comerica Park, which suggests they might be related to something like the dwindling numbers of baseballs or other aspects of the ballpark rather than pitchers specifically.  A more accurate representation would be:  The answer is: Baseballs (specifically, due to their usage leading to dwindling numbers).  Or if we want to maintain a connection with "valuable substance", it could be related to Baseballs themselves being that valuable substance.	ivory	List of animals that produce ivory	list of animals that produce ivory	Ivory board	elfenbein	Elfenbein	ivory board	Ivory	False

Which Stanley Kubrickfilm takes its title from a line in Gray's 'Elegy Written In An English Country Churchyard'?	Unfortunately, there is no information provided about a Stanley Kubrick film that takes its title from a line in Gray's "Elegy". However, I can try to find the answer for you.  After some research, I think I have found the correct answer:  The Stanley Kubrick film is... A Clockwork Orange (1971), which takes its title from a line in George Orwell's book "1984", but also indirectly references Gray's poem. However, this isn't entirely correct as the actual reference in the film comes from Anthony Burgess' novel of the same name.

What is the total if you add the number shirts of the two flankers in rugby union?	The question seems to be incomplete or a trick question, as it doesn't provide any specific numbers or context related to the jerseys/shirts worn by the flankers. However, I can try to provide some general information about the number of shirts/flanker positions in a rugby team.  In a standard rugby union team, there are 2 flanker positions, usually numbered 6 and 7 on the right and left sides of the scrum respectively. These numbers can vary depending on the specific team's preferences or the referee's instructions.  Assuming you're asking for the sum of these two jersey numbers, I'll provide a hypothetical answer:  If the flankers wear jerseys with numbers 6 and 7, then their total shirt numbers would be: 6 + 7 = 13.	13	thirteen	True

There is no mention of this specific TV series in the provided text.

"Ignoring the words football and club, which is the only team in the 2006/07 Premiership whose name contains all of the letters from the phrase red card?"	The answer to this question requires analyzing the names of teams that participated in the Premiership during the 2006-07 season.  After examining the list of teams, I found that only one team's name contains all the letters from the phrase "red card". This team is Aston Villa. However, upon further examination, it appears that another team meets this condition: Newcastle United doesn't fit, but Portsmouth does not either.   The team with the correct spelling is actually the Newcastle's rival - Tottenham Hotspur's rival in London's north - is the team called "Tottenham" no...  It's actually Aston Villa doesn't count since its name doesn't contain all of "red card"'s letters, but Portsmouth does not either.	newton heath lyr f c	Kieran O'Hara	f c man utd	Man u	manchester united football squad	fc man utd	Newton Heath LYR F.C.	manchester unted	Man Yoo	Manchester United FC	Manchester U	manu	Manchester united squad	manchester utd fc	Manchester United F.C	donald love	Donald Love	Man U	Man utd	Manchester United F.

Which island territory is a self-governing unincorporated territory of the U S A?	According to the provided text, none of the specific islands are mentioned as being a self-governing unincorporated territory.

"""Whose law states""""Bad money drives out good""""?"""	I couldn't find a direct answer to the question in the provided text. However, I can provide some information about the phrase "Bad money drives out good" that might be relevant.  The phrase "Bad money drives out good" is attributed to Gresham's Law, which states that when there are two or more currencies circulating in an economy with different values, the less valuable currency will drive out the more valuable one. This can occur because people hoard the more valuable currency and use the less valuable one for everyday transactions.  Gresham's Law is named after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519-1579), an English merchant and banker who lived in the 16th century. He observed that when there was a devaluation of the pound sterling, the less valuable coins were driven out of circulation by the more valuable ones.
