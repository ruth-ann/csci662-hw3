The question doesn't mention Colombia, it mentions Argentina. According to the text, Argentina's new Adidas shirt features "Colombian Blue" stripes, but this is actually the description of their shirt design, not Colombia's.

John Smith, though not mentioned in this list, is often cited as Leader of the Opposition in the UK from 1983 to 1994. However, he passed away in May 1994. The correct answer for the period 1994-1997 would be Margaret Beckett briefly until John Major's Conservative Party regained its majority after calling a snap election, but more notably it was John Smith's successor as Leader of the Opposition, John Smith's party leadership being succeeded by Margaret Beckett and then by John Prescott (though Prescott didn't become Labour leader), or John Prescott who wasn't opposition leader. The correct answer is not in the provided list, though it can be inferred that John Smith's party was led first briefly by Margaret Beckett and then by Gordon Brown after John Smith's death, until the next general election.

Actually, I think there might be some confusion! The article is about the Cassini mission to Saturn, but it doesn't mention Cassini's Division specifically. However, I can tell you that the Cassini spacecraft was indeed orbiting around Saturn during its mission.  Cassini's Division refers to a large gap in Saturn's rings, which was discovered by Giovanni Cassini himself (the same astronomer who the spacecraft is named after). So, while not directly mentioned in this article, it's associated with the planet Saturn.

According to the documents, there are two ways to count the number of days in Lent:  1. The period of the Lenten fast (which most people consider to be "Lent") lasts for 46 days. 2. However, if we exclude the six Sundays within this period (since they are feast days and not fast days), then the actual number of days that Jesus spent fasting is mirrored: 40 days.

Clive Allen and Keith Houchen did not score a goal each for their respective teams, but rather Clive Allen scored 2 goals for Tottenham, including one in extra time, while Keith Houchen scored 1 goal for Coventry.  However, if you are asking which player scored the winning goal for either team, it was Keith Houchen who scored the winner for Coventry with a header from a Trevor Peake cross in the 89th minute of normal play or shortly after it.  But actually, I found that Clive Allen and Keith Houchen did score both sides' goals which were their respective teams' only goals (excluding extra-time).

Based on the question, I'll provide an answer.  However, please note that this question is not related to any of the provided categories (e.g., East, West Home's Best; A "Pot Pourri" of Local Interest, DUPLICATES) and seems to be a standalone question.   If we look at the general knowledge and recent events, I couldn't find any information about an English footballer who died in February last year aged 91.

According to the document, the last album the Beatles worked on together was Abbey Road, and they still had another album's worth of unreleased material when Paul McCartney announced the band's split in April 1970. However, it does not specifically state that Abbey Road was the "last" Beatles album to be recorded before the band split up.  To answer your question accurately, the document only mentions that there were recording sessions from early 1969 for Let It Be, which were completed after Abbey Road was released. Therefore, we can infer that Abbey Road (released in September 1969) was likely one of the last Beatles albums to be recorded before the band split up.  However, it's worth noting that according to other sources (not mentioned in this document), The Beatles had started working on Let It Be in January 1969, and some sessions for the album continued even after Abbey Road was released.

Toronto. The Toronto Maple Leafs (hockey) and the Toronto Blue Jays (baseball) are based in this city.
The answer is: Pitchers.  However, I must note that the text does not directly address the topic of Schreger lines or their relation to a specific substance. Schreger lines are actually a unique feature found in the seats of Comerica Park, which suggests they might be related to something like the dwindling numbers of baseballs or other aspects of the ballpark rather than pitchers specifically.  A more accurate representation would be:  The answer is: Baseballs (specifically, due to their usage leading to dwindling numbers).  Or if we want to maintain a connection with "valuable substance", it could be related to Baseballs themselves being that valuable substance.

Unfortunately, there is no information provided about a Stanley Kubrick film that takes its title from a line in Gray's "Elegy". However, I can try to find the answer for you.  After some research, I think I have found the correct answer:  The Stanley Kubrick film is... A Clockwork Orange (1971), which takes its title from a line in George Orwell's book "1984", but also indirectly references Gray's poem. However, this isn't entirely correct as the actual reference in the film comes from Anthony Burgess' novel of the same name.  But more specifically related to your question is actually A Clockwork Orange does indeed reference the famous line: "What shall I do with a drunken sailor?"

The question seems to be incomplete or a trick question, as it doesn't provide any specific numbers or context related to the jerseys/shirts worn by the flankers. However, I can try to provide some general information about the number of shirts/flanker positions in a rugby team.  In a standard rugby union team, there are 2 flanker positions, usually numbered 6 and 7 on the right and left sides of the scrum respectively. These numbers can vary depending on the specific team's preferences or the referee's instructions.  Assuming you're asking for the sum of these two jersey numbers, I'll provide a hypothetical answer:  If the flankers wear jerseys with numbers 6 and 7, then their total shirt numbers would be: 6 + 7 = 13.

There is no mention of this specific TV series in the provided text. The text appears to be a comprehensive list of references to the Daleks from various media, including books, movies, TV shows, merchandise, and games.  However, I can suggest that you may be thinking of "Terry Nation's Dalekmania" or possibly "Doctor Who", which is the original British science fiction television series created by Sydney Newman and produced by the BBC. The first episode of Doctor Who was broadcast on November 23, 1963, but it featured a different cast than what you described.  If you're thinking of another TV series that aired between 1964-65, I'd be happy to try and help you identify it. Please provide more information or details about the show, such as its plot, tone, or any other distinctive features that you remember.

Unfortunately, the text does not provide the answer directly. However, I can suggest that a common title used for this radio series is "The Goon Show", but it was originally titled as "Carpenters" in 1951 and then changed to its more famous name.

The answer to this question requires analyzing the names of teams that participated in the Premiership during the 2006-07 season.  After examining the list of teams, I found that only one team's name contains all the letters from the phrase "red card". This team is Aston Villa. However, upon further examination, it appears that another team meets this condition: Newcastle United doesn't fit, but Portsmouth does not either.   The team with the correct spelling is actually the Newcastle's rival - Tottenham Hotspur's rival in London's north - is the team called "Tottenham" no...

The text does mention that Puerto Rico has the status of a commonwealth, which is "a legal and political status that is above a territory but still below a state." This suggests that Puerto Rico may have more autonomy than other unincorporated territories.  However, if I had to choose an island from the list provided in the text (Baker, Howland, Kingman Reef, Jarvis, Johnston, Midway, Palmyra, and Wake Islands), I would say that Baker Island is not specifically mentioned as having a high degree of autonomy.   It's worth noting that none of these islands are explicitly described as self-governing unincorporated territories in the provided text.

The organization mentioned in the text is likely to be the Red Cross or a similar humanitarian organization, but the specific one that fits the context and matches the mention of being "originally founded in Canada" is:   The Boy Scouts of Canada (now known as Scouts Canada) was indeed originally founded in 1908 by Robert Baden-Powell in England.

But neither is closely associated with the Liberator Building Society.

I couldn't find a direct answer to the question in the provided text. However, I can provide some information about the phrase "Bad money drives out good" that might be relevant.  The phrase "Bad money drives out good" is attributed to Gresham's Law, which states that when there are two or more currencies circulating in an economy with different values, the less valuable currency will drive out the more valuable one. This can occur because people hoard the more valuable currency and use the less valuable one for everyday transactions.  Gresham's Law is named after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519-1579), an English merchant and banker who lived in the 16th century. He observed that when there was a devaluation of the pound sterling, the less valuable coins were driven out of circulation by the more valuable ones.
