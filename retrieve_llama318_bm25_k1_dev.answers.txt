According to the standard rules of Monopoly, the answer is "Marvin Gardens" (not mentioned in your question) but according to the information given, it should be: Boardwalk. However, since "The Strand" doesn't exist on a regular Monopoly board and there isn't an official "Vine Street", I'll assume you're referring to the standard US version of the game.  There is no official location called "The Strand". However, if we follow the sequence of streets, we have:  1. Mediterranean Avenue 2. Baltic Avenue 3. Oriental Avenue 4. Vermont Avenue 5. Connecticut Avenue 6. States Avenue (also known as Park Place in some versions) 7. Virginia Avenue 8. St. James Place 9. Tennessee Avenue 10. New York Avenue 11. Kentucky Avenue 12. Indiana Avenue 13. Illinois Avenue 14. Atlantic Avenue  And then we have the famous:  15. Ventnor Avenue (not Vine Street, which is in Chicago) 16. Marvin Gardens (although I mentioned it was not present earlier) 17. Pacific Avenue  18. North Carolina Avenue 19. Pennsylvania Railroad 20. Short Line 21. Baltic Avenue (second instance, actually Boardwalk in some US versions) 22. Mediterranean Avenue (second instance)  So, after Boardwalk, the next location would be Park Place (officially known as States Avenue), not "The Strand" or "Vine Street". However, on a standard board there isn't an official space called "The Strand", and no official locations between Vine Street and The Strand.

The answer to this question cannot be determined without further context. However, based on the provided text, I can try to help you with your second question.  To answer whether the statement "Which five letter astronomical word is derived from the Greek for 'long tailed'?" is true or false, we need more information about which specific term is being referred to.  However, one possible solution could be related to a comet. A comet is indeed described in the text as having a tail, and it is mentioned that comets were given names after their discoverers during the 20th century. One of the most famous comets is Halley's Comet (C/1995 O1), which has a long tail.  If we look at the Greek origin for "long tailed," we find that the word for it is "μακροτράλοις" or more accurately in this context, the name of the comet is derived from the Greek word "makrós" (μακρός) meaning "long" and "trállos" (τραλλός) meaning "tail".

However, based on the context of the 2001 Wimbledon tournament, which included players like Ivanisevic and Rafter, we can deduce that Roger Federer was not yet a major player in 2001 (the best player of the 00s). Mark Edmondson is mentioned as the second lowest ranked major champion behind Goran Ivanisevic but it does not provide information about Germans winning Wimbledon.

Do anything you want. But don't forget to change the record."  However, I believe that the correct answer is that Stanley Kubrick was inspired by the poem and its themes, but did not use any specific line directly as the title for his film.

The question seems incomplete, but I'll provide an answer based on common knowledge about rugby union.  In rugby union, a flanker is typically a back row player who wears the numbers 6 and 7 jerseys. The number 6 jersey is usually worn by one of the flankers (a blindside or a openside flanker), while the number 7 jersey is worn by the other flanker.  To answer your question:  Number 6 jersey = 6 shirts Number 7 jersey = 7 shirts  Adding them together: 6 + 7 = 13  So, the total number of shirts if you add the numbers of the two flankers in rugby union is 13.

Based on the text, I can answer your question as follows:  The new £20 note was actually introduced in 2007, not the £5 note.

Regarding the £5 note, it does not mention whose portrait will be featured on the new £5 note due to be issued in 2016.  However, based on the text from 2009, which mentions a report about new banknotes featuring religious leaders, it is stated that there are no plans for this.   The correct answer would be False as the question suggests that the new note features someone other than the monarch and according to the text there is no information provided about who will feature on the £5 note due to be issued in 2016.  However, according to recent news (not included in the provided text), the new £5 note was introduced in 2016, featuring Sir Winston Churchill.

However, based on general knowledge, Gérard Depardieu is often referred to as the "French De Niro" due to his similar acting style and physique to Robert De Niro.   As for your true or false question, I'll need more context to provide a definitive answer.
The answer is FALSE.  However, based on the description provided, I can try to identify what might be referred to:  The description mentions a "home for music and intimate performance" that flourished in early 20th century Europe. This sounds like a cabaret or a concert hall, but it's not specific enough to pinpoint an exact style or venue.  But one famous example of a similar concept is the Music Hall. A music hall was a popular entertainment venue in Europe during the 19th and early 20th centuries, known for its intimate performances, variety shows, and cabaret-style acts. These venues were indeed attended by a wide cross-section of society and featured many notable performers.  If I had to take an educated guess, I'd say that the description is likely referring to Music Hall, but without more information or context, it's hard to be certain.  It's worth noting that Sparks' Ron Mael mentions in the text that Ron wrote the song "This Town 'Aint Big Enough for Both Of Us" as a tribute to Western movies he grew up watching. This might hint at a connection to music halls, which were known for hosting performances based on popular entertainment trends of the time, including Westerns and other films.
The answer is:  **True**  The traditional term that refers to the difference between a price paid for a company or business, and the actual (lower) "book value" of its assets, is:  **Goodwill**  In accounting, goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net asset value of an acquired business. It was first described by William Paton in 1922 but the term itself has been used since the late 1800s.  It is worth noting that this concept is still widely used today and is considered a valuable intangible asset for businesses, especially when acquiring other companies or assets.

However, the final part of your query asks about whose law states "Bad money drives out good." This appears unrelated to the preceding financial texts.  If you're asking for attribution regarding the phrase "Bad money drives out good," it's attributed to Gresham's Law, named after Sir Thomas Gresham, a 16th-century English merchant and economist.
**True**  The correct answer is: Meningitis.  Explanation:  Meningitis refers to inflammation of the meninges, which are the protective membranes that surround the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain and spinal cord. The meninges produce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that cushions the CNS and provides a barrier against infection. Inflammation of these membranes can be caused by various factors, such as bacterial or viral infections, fungi, or other pathogens. Meningitis is a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention to prevent complications, including brain damage, seizures, and death.  The term "meningitis" comes from the Greek words "meninx," meaning membrane, and "itis," meaning inflammation.

There doesn't seem to be a question about the most successful Australian film of the 1980s. However, I can provide some general information on Australian films from that era.  The 1980s was a notable period for Australian cinema, with several iconic and influential films being released during this time. Some of the most well-known and successful Australian films from the 1980s include:  * "Mad Max" (1979) - an action film directed by George Miller * "Breaker Morant" (1980) - a war drama film directed by Bruce Beresford * "The Year My Voice Broke" (1987) - a coming-of-age drama film directed by John Duigan * "Gallipoli" (1981) - a war drama film directed by Peter Weir * "Annie's Coming Out" (1984) - a comedy-drama film directed by Graeme Clifford  It's worth noting that the Australian Film Commission and other organizations have recognized several films from this era as significant or influential, but there isn't a single film widely regarded as the most successful financially.  If you meant to ask about Olympic athletes or events, I'd be happy to help with that.

**True.**  Isaac Asimov is the science fiction author who invented the 3 Laws of Robotics in his 1942 short story "Runaround". The laws are:  1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.  These laws have since been widely referenced and debated in science fiction, philosophy, and ethics, inspiring numerous adaptations and interpretations.

**Answer:** True.  The text states that SETI refers to "the collective name for a number of activities to search for extra-terrestrial life using scientific methods" and then continues with the question: "search for what, specifically?" implying that the correct answer is already provided in the previous sentence.

The correct answer is:  **True**  In the TV show "The Powerpuff Girls", Sugar, Spice, and Everything Nice are the ingredients used by Professor Utonium to create his three super-powered daughters: Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup. The mysterious substance called Chemical X is added to these ingredients, giving the girls their extraordinary abilities.

The answer is FALSE.  The question seems to be referring to "Shutter Island" (2010) directed by Martin Scorsese, but it is actually about US Marshalls investigating a disappearance at Ashecliffe Hospital on Shutter Island in 1954. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo, however the other US Marshall is played by Ben Kingsley and not Mark Ruffalo.  The correct answer should be:  Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley play US Marshalls investigating the disappearance of a psychiatric patient in the 1950s in the film "Shutter Island" (2010) directed by Martin Scorsese.

There is no specific question asked, but I'll answer the one that can be formed:  The quote "Bad money drives out good" is often attributed to Gresham's Law, named after Sir Thomas Gresham. However, it is also said to have been coined by Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon.  So, the correct answer would be: True (Gresham's Law or Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon).
The correct answer is:  **False**  Gertrude is Hamlet's mother, Laertes is Ophelia's brother, and Horatio is Hamlet's friend. While all three of these characters do appear in Shakespeare's play "Hamlet", the question is asking which play they would be found in, not a multiple-choice list of options.  So, the correct answer is that this information is not requested in the original text.
