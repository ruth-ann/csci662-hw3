The Colombian national football team's traditional kit colours are yellow and blue, but their primary shirt colour is... yellow! They typically wear a bright yellow shirt with blue shorts and socks.
A geography question!  I believe I can provide an educated guess... Cordoba is a major city in Argentina, and indeed it's the second-largest city in that country, after Buenos Aires. Am I correct?
