The question seems incomplete. However, based on general information, boxing is often considered one of the most popular sports to feature in films, but more generally, it can be said that:  Boxing and wrestling have been featured extensively in movies, with many classic films such as "Rocky" (1976) and "Raging Bull" (1980). However, among modern sports, football (soccer), basketball, baseball, and mixed martial arts (MMA) are also frequently depicted in films.  In the context of the provided text about Sochi, Russia, sports that feature prominently include tennis (training athletes like Maria Sharapova) and winter sports, given the city's selection as a host for the 2014 Winter Olympics.

It explains how Walt Disney changed his plans for these attractions multiple times during their development, opting for more innovative and engaging experiences for visitors.  The second text is a trivia question that asks about the occupations of four notable individuals (E.E. Cummings, Walt Disney, Ernest Hemmingway, and Somerset Maugham) during World War I.

The question about who almost killed himself while demonstrating the electrical nature of lightning is actually referring to Benjamin Franklin, not an American statesman. He was conducting his famous kite experiment on June 15, 1752.  So, according to the text:   Benjamin Franklin conducted his famous kite experiment in 1752, drawing electricity from lightning and storing it in a Leyden jar, which sparked a fascination with electricity that led to further research and eventually the invention of the battery by Alessandro Volta.

Additionally, according to the Royal Shakespeare Company's artistic programme for 2016, they had productions at the Barbican Theatre, which suggests that the Barbican is their London home.
The question about the TV series "Bread" seems unrelated to the text about surnames and naming conventions. However, I'll answer it anyway.  The main characters in the British sitcom "Bread" (1986-1991) were the Hapgood family. The father was Freddie Hapgood, and his wife was Sandra Hapgood. There wasn't a specific central character with a surname that stood out as particularly notable in the context of the series.  If you have any other questions about surnames or naming conventions from the provided text, I'd be happy to help!

Since you didn't ask a question that requires a numerical answer or a specific fact from the provided texts, I'll provide the general information about the Monopoly game instead.  The correct answer to your implicit question would be "Bond Street" on a standard UK edition of the Monopoly board. However, without more context or a question related to one of the specific texts you provided (e.g., asking for rules, strategies, or facts from Rento or wikiHow), I'm left assuming you're looking for a general piece of information about Monopoly.  If your question is "On a standard Monopoly board, what lies between Vine Street and The Strand?" in reference to a specific edition of the game (like the classic UK version), then the answer would be Bond Street.
The documents provided don't mention anything about "Open All Hours". The provided information is about the Marx Brothers, Harpo Marx, and his family.   However, I can tell you that the TV show "Open All Hours" is a British sitcom from the 1970s and was set in a grocery shop. According to my general knowledge, the character of Bet Lynch (played by Julia Somerville, later replaced by Lynda Bellingham) delivered milk in the shop.  If you're looking for more information about the show or its characters, I'd be happy to help!

Please provide more context or clarify the question if you'd like me to assist further.

The answer is Moulin Rouge! (Note: The question asks for a "musical film", but Moulin Rouge! is actually based on the Orphean myth and Verdi's opera La Traviata, not directly. However, the main theme and plot of the movie are inspired by these sources.)  However, I'll note that the 2001 musical film Moulin Rouge! also has some elements inspired by Giuseppe Verdi's operas.  So, to answer your question directly: Moulin Rouge!

A research question!  According to the text, before she was a Member of Parliament, Margaret Thatcher's occupations included:  1. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and Thatcher at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in September 1982 (not relevant) 2. Thatcher meets personnel aboard the HMS Antrim during her trip to the Falkland Islands in January 1983 (again, not relevant) 3. None of the photos in the "Before she was a Member of Parliament" section mention specific occupations.  However, according to a previous photo, Margaret Thatcher worked as:  1. A teacher or a researcher, but it's not explicitly stated. 2. A chemist (not mentioned in this text). 3. The most likely answer is that she worked as a chemist before entering politics. However, there are no photos or information about her occupation before becoming a Member of Parliament.  Based on general knowledge and other sources, I can tell you that Margaret Thatcher was indeed a research chemist at the University of Oxford and later became a lecturer in chemistry at the University of Oxford's Somerville College before entering politics.

However, if you're looking for general knowledge related to the question, I can tell you that the Ascari sports car is actually an Italian brand.
Rebecca Romero won the gold medal for Great Britain in the Women's Individual Pursuit at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, but not in the Men's category. However, Hayden Roulston of New Zealand won the silver medal in the Men's 4000m Individual Pursuit at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, but a British cyclist did win a medal in the track cycling event.  Actually, a closer look reveals that it was the team pursuit event where Britain secured medals.

The answer to this question is not provided in the text, but based on the context, it can be inferred that F.I.A. (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile) is the governing body for various forms of motor racing and automobile sports.  However, if we are looking at a specific sport mentioned in the text:  * For Stock car racing, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) is the governing body. * For Drag racing, there is no mention of a specific governing body other than the F.I.A. European Drag Racing Championships being broadcast on various channels.  But if we're looking at a general answer that applies to most of the sports mentioned in the text:  F.I.A. (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile) is the governing body for many forms of motor racing and automobile sports, but it's not explicitly stated as the governing body for all the sports mentioned.  However, if we look at Grand Prix motor racing, which is one of the most prominent forms of motor racing:  The answer would be F.I.A. (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile)

Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a specific stately home being built for the Earl of Carlisle in 1699. However, I can provide some information that might be relevant.  There are several Earls of Carlisle throughout history, and one of them was Robert Curzon (1756-1830), who rebuilt Castle Howard, a grand estate in North Yorkshire, in the late 18th century. Castle Howard is often attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor, but it's also been suggested that John Vanbrugh might have had some influence on its design.  However, since you asked about a stately home built for the Earl of Carlisle in 1699, I'll take a guess: Based on my research, I couldn't find any information about a specific stately home being built by the Earl of Carlisle in 1699.
The correct answer is: Athens, Greece (not Rome)  However, I can provide information about a similar structure in Rome. The Arch of Constantine, also known as the Quadriga of Marcus Aurelius, is located in the Roman Forum in Rome, Italy.  But if you are looking for an arch similar to Hadrian's Gate in Rome, it does not exist. However, there is an inscription on the Arch of Constantine that mentions Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus' victory over the Parthians, which could be related to the Hadrian's gate in Athens.  The Arch of Hadrian (Πύλη Αδριανού) is actually located in Athens, Greece.

The question contains an error: the answer I'll provide is for a different part of the text. The correct year for the work "Ecce Homo" is not mentioned in the provided text but it's stated that the sculptor of this work was Elbow Grease (not confirmed), although Mark Twain also created one.  However, according to the text:   The sculptor who produced a work called Ecce Homo in 1934/35 was actually an error. The correct answer is not mentioned in the provided text.
A completely unrelated question!  The answer is Jane Austen. The quote "There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart" (not the exact phrase you mentioned) was actually considered for the new £10 note, but Jane Austen's novels are a good fit for the theme.

Is there something specific you'd like me to help with regarding this topic?

The pattern appears to be a series of New Testament books written by Paul the Apostle. The sequence seems to be:  1. Thessalonian letters (1 Thessalonians and 2 Thessalonians) 2. Timothy letters (1 Timothy and 2 Timothy)  So, if we continue this pattern, the next book in the series would likely be:  **3 John or Hebrews**  However, considering the context of the text provided, which appears to be a biblical study on Jezebel from the Old Testament, it's possible that the question is not about the Pauline epistles but rather about what comes next in a different sequence.  If we consider the sequence of books in the Old Testament or the order of events in 1 Kings (where Jezebel appears), the next book or event might be:  **2 Kings**  This would continue the narrative of the history of Israel, following the story of Jezebel and her eventual downfall.
In 1969, P H Newby's book "Something to Answer For" was the first winner of the Booker Prize.

However, specific types of flies can be referred to by other names such as:  * Gnats (small, fragile-looking two-winged flies) * Mosquitoes (flies with piercing and sucking mouthparts) * Midges (minute, fragile flies in several families)  So, the answer depends on the specific type of fly being referred to. But in general, an insect of the order Diptera is more commonly called a "fly".

The text doesn't directly answer the question about the relation between William III and Charles I.  However, we can find the information in other sources:  Charles I (1600-1649) was a King of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1625 until his execution in 1649. His son, Charles II (1630-1685), succeeded him.  William III (1650-1702) was the joint monarch of England, Scotland, and Ireland with his wife Mary II from 1689 until her death in 1694. He was a Prince of Orange and became King after the Glorious Revolution.  According to genealogical records, William III was the nephew and son-in-law of Charles I:  * Charles I's daughter, Henrietta Anne Stuart (1644-1713), married Philippe I, Duke of Orléans (1640-1701). * Their daughter, Marie Louise d'Orléans (1662-1695), married William III. * William III was also the nephew of Charles I through his sister Mary's marriage to Prince George Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp (1659-1708).  So, to answer your question: William III was the son-in-law and nephew of Charles I.

The answer is: Pluto.  However, it's worth noting that the debate about whether or not Pluto is a "planet" or a "dwarf planet" is still ongoing. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the term "planet," which led to Pluto being reclassified as a dwarf planet. However, many people still refer to it as a "plutoid" and not a full-fledged planet.  But, in the context of your question, I believe you are referring to NASA's New Horizons probe, which flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015, after traveling for about 9 years and covering a distance of around 3 billion miles (4.8 billion kilometers).

According to various sources, the chess piece that is also commonly referred to as a "castle" is the Rook. The term "Rook" comes from the Old English word "rōc", which means "corner stone" or "fortress". In some languages, such as Italian and Spanish, this piece is still called a "Torre" (tower) or "Torreón" (strong tower), respectively.  The Rook's shape has evolved over time, but it was originally depicted as a chariot or war carriage in the game of Chaturanga, from which modern chess originated. In Europe, the term "Rook" became associated with a castle due to its resemblance to a medieval fortress.  So, to summarize:  * The Rook is the chess piece that is also commonly referred to as a "castle". * The term "Rook" comes from Old English and means "corner stone" or "fortress". * In some languages, this piece is still called a "tower" or "strong tower", reflecting its original depiction as a chariot or war carriage.

The text does mention Robert Owen and Frances Morrison, as well as the Working Class Movement Library in Salford, but it does not contain any information about a theatre. However, based on the description of the painter's birth and death years (1887-1976), I can try to find some information.  The only British painter who comes close to this time period is LS Lowry, who lived from 1887 to 1976 and was born in Manchester but spent a lot of his life in Salford.

The answer is Castor oil.

It's also known to have been used in treating poisoned arrow wounds due to its ability to neutralize certain toxins.  Castor oil, on the other hand, is an edible oil extracted from the seeds of the Ricinus communis plant, as described in the provided text.

Based on the text, I'm going to take a guess that you're looking for information about a specific horror movie. However, there is no direct answer to your question in the provided text.  But, considering the format of your question, I'm assuming it might be related to one of the references mentioned in the "Film" section under "Scream (1996)" where it mentions that Randy explains the rules to surviving a horror movie.   If so, the question is actually answered later on when referring to another film.  The answer is: The 1978 film is not directly named but a similar reference can be found in the text which mentions Scream (1996) where Randy explains the rules for surviving a horror movie, and one of those rules is related to wearing a mask. This might indicate that you are thinking about the horror movie Scream itself.  If I'm correct in assuming this, then your question seems to be asking when Scream was released: it's indeed 1996 but since there was no direct reference to a 1978 horror movie with this description earlier on I would say the answer is actually related to the film Scream.

The relevant line from Gray's poem reads:  "Full many a gem of purest ray serene The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear: Full many a flow'r is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air."  However, I'll note that this question has nothing to do with Thomas Hardy.

But, according to the text, what Americans call a "vest", Brits would typically refer to as an "undershirt" or an "undersleeve".

Actually, there is no mention of the "Oscillating Universe Theory" in the text. However, it seems you are referring to a concept that describes the universe undergoing cycles of expansion and contraction.  If I had to choose from the text, I would say that the Oscillating Universe Theory combines Big Bang with the Big Crunch to make up a cycle, which is related to the concept of the ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) cycle. However, this is not exactly what you are asking.  But if we look at another theory, it seems more likely that you are thinking about the Cyclic Model, also known as the "Eternal Return" or "Oscillating Universe" model. This model proposes that the universe undergoes cycles of expansion and contraction, with each cycle being similar to the previous one.  In this context, the Big Bang is combined with the Big Crunch (the event marking the end of a cycle) to make up a cycle.  So, my answer would be: The Big Crunch.

However, it does mention Sir Robert Walpole was imprisoned in the Tower of London for receiving an illegal payment during his first stint in government.  But if we consider Harold Wilson's contemporaries or peers, none of them are mentioned as going to jail for fraud in the text.

The text discusses various forms of intoxicating drinks and substances, including beer, wine, cannabis, opium poppies, hemp, fungi, and mushrooms, but it does not specifically mention the chemical names of alcohols found in these substances.  However, I can provide general information on the formal chemical name for ethanol, which is a common type of alcohol found in many intoxicating drinks:  Ethanol's systematic chemical name is Ethyl alcohol, but its more precise and formal name is Propan-1-ol (IUPAC nomenclature).

The question does not ask for a specific answer about binary numbers. The text mentions various concepts related to binary, such as bitwise operators, programming languages, and numeral systems. If you're asking what is typically considered a "larger" number in the context of binary, it would depend on the values being compared.  However, if I had to infer from the context that you might be thinking about the maximum value that can be represented by a certain number of bits (binary digits), then:  The largest number that can be represented with n bits is 2^n - 1. For example, an 8-bit binary number can represent numbers up to 255 (2^8 - 1).

During this time, Jacques Chirac was the President of France from 1995 until his resignation in 2007, and Nicolas Sarkozy took over as President after him.  However, since the text does not provide a specific year or range of years for the question "Who was the President of France for most of the decade?", it is difficult to give a definitive answer.

According to Wikipedia, in 2012, the European Union had 27 member states.  Please let me know if this is what you were looking for or if I can help with anything else.

Based on the description provided:  "The magician Prospero shipwrecks the enemies that originally ousted him from Italy, but when Ferdinand falls for his daughter Miranda he finally faces them down and learns to forgive"  The correct answer would be:  **The Tempest**  This play indeed tells the story of Prospero, a magician who seeks revenge against those who wronged him, but ultimately comes to forgive through love.

However, I found that the text does mention a historical figure:  "The Red Cross movement was founded in Geneva in 1863 by a Swiss businessman and social activist named Henry Dunant after he witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino."  But this is not related to Blaise Pascal.  Blaise Pascal introduced "pensions" to France in the 17th century, but this information is not provided in the text.

Unfortunately, I don't see any information about "Sheading" in relation to a specific European island. However, I do notice that you asked about the Mediterranean Sea and its islands.  But if I had to guess based on the text, I would say that "Sheading" might be related to the Isle of Man, which is an island located between England and Ireland in the Irish Sea. The Isle of Man is divided into six sheadings: Arbory, Ballaugh, German, Lonan, Malew, and Rushen.  Please let me know if I'm correct or not!

The text does not explicitly state what Thomas Hardy's last completed novel was. However, it mentions that his last two novels, "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" and "Jude the Obscure", were published in 1891 and 1895, respectively. After these, he announced that he had ceased to write prose fiction in 1898. Therefore, his last completed novel was likely either "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" or "Jude the Obscure".
Thomas Edward Lawrence (also known as Lawrence of Arabia), commonly referred to as T.E. Lawrence, had the Greek phrase "Τί Μελέτης" (or "Ti Mēletēs") carved into the pediment above his cottage door at Cloudshill, Dorset. This translates to English as "Why worry?"

There is no information about specific states in the provided text. The text appears to be a summary of economic and demographic data for the United States as a whole. Therefore, it is not possible to answer your question based on the provided information.  However, if you're looking for information on unemployment rates by state, I can suggest some resources that might help:  1. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website: The BLS provides detailed data on employment and unemployment statistics for each state. 2. State labor department websites: Each state's labor department typically publishes its own unemployment rate data.  If you're interested in finding out which states have high unemployment rates, I can try to provide some general information or point you in the direction of a reliable resource.
According to the provided documents, Sergei Rachmaninoff was a pianist and composer who made over a hundred recordings and gave over one thousand concerts as a soloist, demonstrating his expertise as a pianist. However, there is also a mention of him being compared to Nicolai Paganini, another virtuoso violinist, due to their similar characteristics (such as having Marfan's syndrome) and the incredible difficulty of their compositions.  So, to answer the question: Sergei Rachmaninoff was a virtuoso on both the piano and possibly implied to be similar in virtuosity with Nicolai Paganini on the violin.
Mercury is not mentioned in the text, but rather "the craters Brahms and Liszt" are referred to. Based on additional information outside of this particular text snippet, it appears that these craters are actually located on Mercury.  However, another reference in the provided text mentions Franz Liszt. This text also discusses Sergei Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, and Brahms is mentioned as one of the composers who wrote variations based on Paganini's theme.  Therefore, to answer the question within the scope of this particular text snippet: there is no information provided about craters named after Brahms or Liszt. However, it can be inferred from other sources that these craters are located on Mercury.

The correct answer to the question asked about a common aspect among Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism is not provided. However, based on general knowledge:  The Pali and Sanskrit languages are closely related to these religions, but they do share a common language or linguistic roots. They all originated from ancient India and share many cultural, philosophical, and linguistic elements.  However, if the question was referring to a specific aspect, it would be more accurate to say that Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism often use Sanskrit as a common language for their texts and scriptures, particularly in their classical or traditional forms.

It's worth noting that the Serpentine Lake is a large artificial lake located in the northwest corner of Hyde Park, London. The original lake was constructed by George II's royal gardener, William Kent, but it has undergone several changes and expansions over the centuries.

According to the text, Jacques Cartier visited Newfoundland and Labrador in 1534, but I couldn't find any specific mention of a notable event or achievement by him that can be pinpointed to a single year.  However, it is mentioned that he arrived in 1534.   If you're looking for other information about Cartier's voyages, here are some relevant dates:  * 1534: Cartier first visited North America and explored the coast of Newfoundland. * 1535-1536: He led a second expedition to Canada, during which he explored the St. Lawrence River and claimed the region for France.  So, these two years (1534-1536) are significant in Cartier's life as an explorer.

A Cabaret.  Cabarets were popular entertainment venues that featured music, dance, and theatrical performances, often with a focus on intimate settings and avant-garde or risqué content. They were indeed well-established in Europe by the 19th century and flourished in the early 20th century, drawing a diverse audience from high society to bohemians.  The name "Cabaret" comes from the French word for "gathering place," which aptly describes these unique venues that brought together people from various walks of life to enjoy live performances. Cabarets have also been featured in numerous films, such as the 1972 classic "Cabaret," which was set in 1930s Berlin and starred Liza Minnelli as Sally Bowles.  In the context of your question, it seems like the reference is to a specific type of performance venue that has a rich history and cultural significance.

A great question about Scottish football history!  The answer is: Ayr United.  However, I think you may be thinking of Ayr's local rivals. The correct answer to the question "Which coastal Scottish Football League team are known as 'The Honest Men'?" would actually be Partick Thistle were not it but rather...   Ayr United and Rangers both have nicknames but one is known as 'the gers', I think you might be looking for a different answer so Ayr aren't the ones that spring to mind for me, although they are from the coastal region of Scotland.  The actual answer to this would be: Partick Thistle (not really)  Actually its Greenock Morton

A ravine with sloping sides that is often dry in summer would typically be described as an arroyo.

The correct answer is: BS 5750.  BS 5750 was a British standard for quality management systems that was introduced in the late 1970s. It was widely adopted by UK companies and was seen as a benchmark for quality excellence. When the ISO 9000 series of standards was published, it effectively superseded BS 5750, becoming the new international standard for quality management systems.  BS 5750 has since been withdrawn from publication, but its legacy continues to influence quality management practices around the world. The ISO 9000 series of standards remains widely used and is recognized as a global benchmark for quality excellence in industry and commerce.

However, this is not the main topic of discussion in the text you provided.

The question seems incomplete. However, based on the context of the surrounding text, it appears that you are asking about a proverb.  The answer is: Gresham's Law, which was named after Sir Thomas Gresham, an English merchant and economist in the 16th century. The law states that "bad money drives out good", meaning that when there is a mixture of high-quality currency (good money) and low-quality currency (bad money), people will eventually stop using the good money because it can be easily replaced with the bad money, leading to a devaluation of the good money.

Unfortunately, I don't have enough information in the provided text to determine which football team you are referring to. The text does mention Camp Nou as the home stadium of FC Barcelona and mentions that there were plans for its modernisation and expansion in 2007, but it does not provide any specific information about a team playing at the "1992 Olympic Stadium" or moving to an "Estadi Cornella-El Prat".  However, I think you may be thinking of RCD Espanyol, who played home matches at the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys (also known as the 1992 Olympic Stadium) until 2019. They have since moved to a new stadium called the RCDE Stadium, not the "Estadi Cornella-El Prat" (which I believe is actually the home stadium of UE Cornellà).

In the Brave New World, people take a drug called soma to achieve a state of bliss or happiness.

In 1947, when Pakistan and India gained independence from British colonial rule, the country that is now Myanmar (Burma) was a separate entity with its own borders. Prior to this, it was a province of British Burma.   By the mid-20th century, in the 1950s specifically, the borders of what is now Myanmar would have been adjacent to Pakistan, India, Tibet, China, and possibly Siam (now Thailand), but not French Indo-China as Siam would be an independent nation by then.  However, I must note that these countries' borders were subject to change due to colonial legacies and border adjustments.

The text doesn't mention who was elected as the President of the European Parliament in July 2009. However, it does mention that Hans-Gert Pottering stated his position on the Irish referendum result in a written statement. Therefore, I can provide some additional information based on general knowledge.  Hans-Gert Pottering served as the President of the European Parliament from 2004 to 2007. He was not elected in July 2009 but was still an important figure in the Parliament at that time.  However, if you're looking for who was elected President of the European Parliament after Hans-Gert Pottering's term ended, it would have been Jerzy Buzek (acting) and then Jerzy Buzek and then Jerzy Buzek was acting from 2007 to 2008 and in July 2009 Jerzy Buzek was replaced by Jerzy Buzek was not elected but he was acting president then Jerzy Buzek gave up his duties to Hans-Gert Pottering's successor which is the correct answer.

The text mentions that Knud Rasmussen (1879-1933) was a Greenlandic polar explorer and anthropologist who made several notable expeditions. One of them might have been through the Bering Strait.  Another possible candidate is Vilhjalmur Stefansson, an Icelandic-born Canadian explorer, but no information about him in 1906 is provided in the text.  However, I can suggest a well-known explorer who sailed round northern Canada and possibly through the Bering Strait:  It is Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930), Norwegian explorer.

Alaska is the state in question, but it does not have the forget-me-not as its state flower.

The official flower of New Mexico is the Yucca flower but also the forget me not flower, often called the "Forget-Me-Not" (Myosotis latifolia). The state flower of Alaska was previously considered to be a species of forget-me-not.
