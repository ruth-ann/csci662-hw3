The question doesn't mention a specific king's reign during which Columbus discovered the New World. However, I can tell you that Christopher Columbus made his famous voyage to the Americas in 1492, and he worked under the sponsorship of the Catholic Monarchs, King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, who ruled Spain at that time.  If you're asking about a British king, it's worth noting that the British monarchy didn't exist as we know it today during Columbus' time. The Kingdom of England existed separately from the Kingdom of Scotland, and they were united under a single monarch in 1707 with the Acts of Union.  However, if I had to answer your original question based on the provided text, I'd say that there is no mention of Columbus discovering the New World during the reign of any British king.
According to the examples in the text, to find two thirds of a number, you divide it by 3, then multiply by 2. To find one third of a number, you simply divide it by 3.  So, to find a ninth divided by a third, we can follow this logic:  1/9 is one ninth of a number 1/3 is one third of a number  To find the relationship between a ninth and a third, let's first express them as fractions with a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 9 is 9.  1/9 = 3/27 1/3 = 9/27  Now we can divide:  (3/27) / (9/27) = (3/27) * (27/9) = 3/9  So, a ninth divided by a third is equal to one third.

Unfortunately, the provided text doesn't explicitly mention which horse Death rides. However, based on general biblical knowledge and common interpretations of Revelation 6:7-8, it can be inferred that Death rides a pale horse.

Its rider's name was Abaddon, and he was given power to bring about a third of humanity’s death..."

There is no information about "Makassar" being an alternative name for "Ujung Pandang". However, I can tell you that Makassar and Ujung Pandang are both cities in Indonesia.   But if we go back to the text provided, we see a mention of Kalimantan for timber and oil, to Papua for mining, and to the cities of Sulawesi and Java. And there's also "Makale (Tallulembangna), Rantepao (Kesu'), Toraja Barat (West Toraja, Mappa-Pana)" which is part of Tana Toraja Regency in South Sulawesi Province.  So the country where Makassar (or Ujung Pandang) is located is Indonesia.

However, according to some historical estimates, the Library of Pergamum is said to have had over 200,000 holdings, but this number may be disputed due to lack of records.  But if I had to choose a city that was home to the largest library, it would be:  * The Royal Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh (modern-day Mosul, Iraq) which held around 30,943 surviving clay tablets.

According to the text, Joan Rivers was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Barnard College at age 19. Since her death occurred in September 2014 and she graduated from college 37 years prior (as of 2012), we can estimate her birth year.  Barnard College Class of 1955 Graduation Year: 1957 (not 1955 as initially mentioned)  If the graduation year was indeed 1957, then Joan Rivers would have been born in 1938 or 1939. Given that she died in September 2014, we can estimate her age at death to be around 75-76 years old.

There is no single composer credited with composing the title music for Doctor Who. The theme was originally composed by Ron Grainer, but it has undergone several revisions over the years. In 2005, Murray Gold took over as the resident composer for the series and wrote new themes for the show.  However, in some specific instances, other composers have created arrangements of the original theme or written their own versions for Doctor Who audio adventures or concerts. For example:  * David Arnold created an arrangement of Ron Grainer's theme used on certain Big Finish Productions audio adventures. * Hans Zimmer played synthesizers on the charity single "Doctor in Distress".  So while there isn't a single composer credited with composing the title music, Ron Grainer is often associated with the original 1960s version of the theme.

The correct answer is: Trier.  However, I couldn't find any information that suggests this site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Porta Nigra is indeed a well-known and preserved Roman city gate in Germany, but it's located in the city of Trier, which has a rich history and many impressive Roman ruins.  It's worth noting that the Mosel Valley itself is not directly a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but it is part of the larger region known as the "Roman Limes", which was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. The Roman Limes stretches from the Alps to the North Sea and includes many Roman ruins and archaeological sites along its route.  So while Trier itself might not be a direct UNESCO World Heritage Site, it's an important part of the broader region that is recognized for its rich history and cultural significance.

(And, as for the Shakespeare history play-related question, it seems to be a separate question that is not directly related to the article.)  If you meant to ask about one of the specific stately homes mentioned in the article, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide more information!

Based on Cate Blanchett's biography, it appears that in the "Indiana Jones" film series, specifically in the 2008 movie "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", there is a science feature related to archaeology and anthropology. However, since the provided text does not go into detail about the specific scientific features or themes in this film, I would recommend consulting additional sources for more accurate information.  One possible connection between Cate Blanchett's biography and science could be her portrayal of Col. Dr. Irina Spalko, a KGB agent with expertise in psychic phenomena and the paranormal, which may be loosely related to parapsychology or pseudoscientific themes. However, without further context from the film itself, this is speculative at best.  To find a more specific answer, I would suggest consulting additional sources, such as online summaries of the movie "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" or scientific reviews on the subject.

However, based on the context and the description provided, it can be inferred that these agreements are collectively referred to as the "Acquis".  In EU terminology, "acquis" (from the French word "acquérir", meaning "to acquire") refers to the collective body of rights, laws, and obligations that make up the entire legislative and regulatory framework of the European Union. This includes not only treaties, agreements, and conventions, but also other types of international commitments made by the EU and its member states.  So, in essence, the answer is "Acquis".

There is no answer provided in the text snippet. The text appears to be a dictionary of terms related to opera and music, but it does not contain information about a specific event or performance leading to a fight for independence.

The main American tank of World War II was the M4 Sherman, a medium tank that saw extensive service throughout the war. However, the development and deployment of tanks by the US Army were complex and involved multiple models.  Initially, the US Army used early versions of the M3 Stuart light tank and the M2 Medium Tank. Later, they adopted the M4 Sherman, which became one of the most widely produced and deployed tanks of World War II.  The M4 Sherman was introduced in 1942 and saw action in both European and Pacific theaters. It was known for its reliability, durability, and versatility, but also criticized for its inadequate armor and firepower compared to some German tanks.  Throughout the war, various modifications and upgrades were made to the M4 Sherman design, including the M4A1, M4A2, M4A3, and others. The tank's production continued until 1945, with over 50,000 units manufactured during the war.  In summary, while there was no single "main" American tank of World War II, the M4 Sherman was one of the most iconic and widely used tanks by the US Army during this period.
