The answer is English.  Kim Kardashian and Armenian-American model Armenia-born Armen "Arty" Sarkissian (also spelled Sarkisian) are examples of individuals with well-known surnames, but the question appears to be asking about a specific surname origin.  If I had to guess which language the surname Kardashian comes from, it's likely from English or Turkish.

As for Sarkisian, it's an Armenian surname, so it likely originates from the Armenian language.  However, without more information or context, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer.

The answer to the question about the series is:  3 John, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, Revelation.  This series lists the order of books in the New Testament of the Bible. The numbers refer to the canonical order of the epistles (letters) and the book of Revelation.  However, if we're looking for a pattern related to binary numbers or counting, I'd like to explore an alternative interpretation:  In binary, each position represents a power of 2: 1 (2^0), 10 (2^1), 11 (2^2), 100 (2^3), and so on. The series could be seen as listing the numbers in order of their binary representation.  With that in mind, the next number in the series would be:  1 (as 1 = 1 in binary) 10 (as 2 = 10 in binary) 11 (as 3 = 11 in binary)  Continuing this pattern, we get:  100 (as 4 = 100 in binary), which corresponds to 1 Corinthians.  Therefore, the next number in the series could be interpreted as:  4 - 1 Corinthians  However, please note that this is a creative interpretation and not directly related to the original context of the question. The correct answer depends on the specific context or topic being discussed.

Wicked.  However, according to your text, it's not just Wicked. Another answer could be The Phantom of the Opera.  Here's why:   * In 1904, L. Frank Baum introduced a new character named Jack Pumpkinhead in his book "The Marvelous Land of Oz". * Some years later, in 1993, Tim Burton created a character named Jack Skellington for the stop-motion animated film "The Nightmare Before Christmas", which is loosely based on Baum's character. * Now, here comes The Phantom of the Opera. In 1986, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Charles Hart wrote a stage musical called "Phantom" with a main character, Erik (also known as the Phantom), who was not in the original book "The Novel of the White Bird". However, he was influenced by two characters from "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz": Dr. Nikkolath, and Dr. Nikko; in which Baum wrote about these doctors who created an opera to entertain a group of Munchkins. * In 1904, L. Frank Baum introduced a new character named Jack Pumpkinhead, but it was not the same as Erik in "Phantom". However, Baum had a strong influence on both characters. * The two main characters from Wicked (Glinda and Elphaba) are also from Baum's book.

However, I can provide some general knowledge about Schreger lines. Schreger lines are indeed unique identifiers found on teeth, specifically in the enamel of molars and premolars. They appear as distinctive transverse ridges and valleys that run across the tooth surface. While I couldn't find information about their relation to a valuable substance or dwindling numbers of something large, they do provide important clues for forensic dentists during identification processes.  Given this context, it's difficult to determine what "valuable substance" or "something large" refers to in the riddle, as there seems to be no connection between Schreger lines and those topics. If you have any more details or clarification about the question, I'll be happy to try and provide a better answer.

Based on the information provided, it is likely that frogs, toads, and other amphibians are the types of creatures that would be bred and reared in a "ranarium", which is a type of enclosure for raising amphibians. The term "ranarium" itself suggests an association with ranids or water frogs, but the general idea of such a facility also encompasses various species within this group.  However, to further narrow down the options based on more precise associations:  - The definition of breed and rearing in relation to animals suggests that any creature suitable for domestication could potentially be bred in a controlled environment like a "ranarium". This includes but is not limited to:   - Frogs and toads   - Fish (especially if breeding aquariums are considered under the broader umbrella of a 'ranarium')   - Small reptiles, such as geckos or some species of snakes, depending on the specific setup.  But without more context about what "ranarium" specifically entails or refers to in terms of creatures it hosts, providing an exact answer is challenging.

There is no information provided in the documents that relates to the Oscillating Universe Theory or its combination with the Big Bang theory. The documents are about different topics, including movies (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang), combine harvesters, and unrelated texts.  However, I can provide a general answer based on my knowledge of cosmology: The Oscillating Universe Theory is an outdated cosmological model that suggests the universe undergoes cycles of expansion and contraction. It combines the Big Bang theory with the idea of a "big crunch" or a "cosmic cycle," where the universe collapses back in on itself after expanding, only to re-expand again in a new Big Bang-like event.  But since this is not directly related to the provided documents, I'll refrain from providing further information.
The answer is "Marie". However, since the question specifically mentions France, I would expect a more specific response. Upon reviewing the documents provided, I did not find any direct reference to a female figure representing France in relation to natural law or jurisprudence.  However, based on general knowledge and the fact that the question is multiple-choice (though not explicitly stated), I can make an educated guess. In many countries, including France, "Marie" (or variations like Maria) is often used as a feminine name associated with national symbols or female figures representing the country.

If you would like me to provide information on these topics, I'll do my best based on general knowledge and external sources.

The question doesn't ask for a specific answer, but rather asks what the larger number of the binary system is.  In the context of the text provided, it seems that the discussion about binary numbers is focused on understanding how they work and their properties, such as doubling in possibilities with each added digit. However, there is no clear reference to comparing the magnitude or "larger" aspect of binary numbers to other numeral systems.  If we consider a broader interpretation, we could discuss the range of values that can be represented by different numeral systems, including binary. In this case, it's worth noting that binary can represent extremely large numbers due to its exponential growth in possibilities with each added digit, as exemplified by the calculation for 50 binary digits: 1,125,899,906,842,624.  If you're asking what the larger number of the binary system is, I'd be happy to provide a clarification or discuss this further. However, please note that there isn't a straightforward answer to this question without more context or specific criteria for comparison.

King Paul of Nigeria won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1929, but that is not among the options. However, among the options, none of them won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1960.  However, I see that one option was: "President Woodrow Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1919."  But since you asked for 1960, I should look at the other options and find the correct answer. In this case, among the options provided is Lord John Boyd Orr, a British nutritionist and health campaigner, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1949.  However, none of these individuals were South African politicians who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1960.  But one of them was not directly mentioned as winning the prize in 1960. However, I see that among the options provided is King Paul of Nigeria won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1929 and Woodrow Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1919 (neither of these individuals were South African politicians).

There is no specific answer that can be pinpointed as a single language common to all three religions. However, Prakrit was a common language spoken by people of various castes in ancient India and was used by both Mahavira and the Buddha for their teachings.

However, I found that the Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park, London was created by George II's royal gardener, William Kent, not in 1730 but in the early 18th century (around 1730-1735). The Serpentine Lake is a large recreational lake in Hyde Park.

According to my knowledge, Cate Blanchett is indeed the actress who has portrayed these characters on film:  * Queen Elizabeth I: in "Elizabeth" (1998) and "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" (2007) * Galadriel: in "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" (2001), "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" (2002), and "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" (2012) * Katharine Hepburn: in "The Aviator" (2004)  * Veronica Guerin: in "Veronica Guerin" (2003)  However, I don't have any information that directly links to "Katharine Hepburn and Veronica Guerin", instead it appears Cate Blanchett played the role of Katherine Hepburn in The Aviator (2004).

The answer is: Salon Concert.  However, based on the context provided, it seems that you are asking about a specific type of music venue, particularly related to Astor Piazzolla's work with tango music.  A more accurate answer would be: Tango House or Milonga (a traditional Argentine dance hall), but considering the 19th and early 20th-century context mentioned in the question, I would say that the name for the venue is likely: Salon Concert, specifically a Salón de Conciertos.  Note: A salón de conciertos was a concert hall or salon where classical music was performed in an intimate setting, often with a focus on chamber music and small ensemble performances.
There is no information in the provided documents that directly answers the question. However, I can provide an answer based on general knowledge.

Based on the provided documents and knowledge, I couldn't find any specific information about a TV series featuring Benedict Cumberbatch (not Ben Wishaw) playing a character who is a gay man. However, it's possible that this might be a reference to "Sherlock" or another show where he played a complex character with LGBTQ+ themes.  However, since the documents mention Tom Robinson and his song "Glad to Be Gay", I'm going to take a guess that the answer might be related to a TV series featuring a gay character inspired by this context. Unfortunately, without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint which exact series is being referred to.  If you have any additional details or clarification about the series, I'd be happy to try and assist further!

The answer is: "The Flintstones."   However, if we're talking about a specific type of TV cartoon series, it's possible that you are thinking of The Muppet Show or Looney Tunes. But considering the fact that these shows were also not exactly a "cartoon series" but rather a mix of comedy and animation, I would say the most successful one is The Flintstones.  It was created by Hanna-Barbera Productions, first aired in 1960, and it's an animated sitcom about the Stone Age lives of the Flintstone family.

The question doesn't mention that a former World War II pilot and Head of the CIA was chosen by Ronald Reagan as his Vice President. However, it's likely referring to George H.W. Bush, who was a naval aviator in World War II (not a pilot) and later became the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) under President Gerald Ford.  It's also possible that the question is referring to George H.W. Bush's vice presidential selection by Ronald Reagan as his running mate in 1980.

The question doesn't specify which year or period you are referring to. However, I can provide some information on the prime ministers who were in office around the time of the Zulu War (1879).  Benjamin Disraeli was the Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1868 to 1880, and he was still in office during the early years of the Zulu War.  Later, Robert Gascoyne Cecil (3rd Marquess of Salisbury) became the Prime Minister in June 1895 and served until July 1902. The Zulu War took place mainly in 1879, but some skirmishes continued into 1880-81.  However, if we look for a Prime Minister during the specific period of the Anglo-Zulu War (January to July 1879), it was Benjamin Disraeli

There is no information provided that supports this question. The text does not mention the film "Chicago" or any other specifics about the year 2002 or the Best Picture award winner for that year.  However, based on general knowledge of movie history, it can be stated that the musical "Chicago" won the Best Picture Oscar in 2003 (not 2002), not in 2002. If we follow this timeline and look at the previous major musical film to win Best Picture, it would be "The Sound of Music" which did not receive the award but a more relevant example would be the movie "My Fair Lady", "West Side Story" and other notable musical films however the one closest that won before 2002 is "West Side Story's" predecessor was "Gigi" in 1958 and then came "The Sound of Music's" competitor,  "West Side Story's" fellow Oscar nominated film "West Side Story's" companion piece to "The West Side Story's" rival for the award but not a musical that won best picture since 'My Fair Lady' so we can conclude that its "My Fair Lady"

According to the provided texts, it is not directly stated whose law or theory specifically states "bad money drives out good." However, this phrase is often associated with Gresham's Law in economics. But within the provided documents on Natural Law and Philosophy of Law, there is a mention of Aristotle's ideas, which include the concept of a "common law" or "higher law" that is according to nature (Rhetoric 1373b2). Additionally, Thomas Aquinas conflated the idea of natural rights with several orders of law, including eternal, natural, human, and divine.  It's worth noting that Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas both contributed significantly to the development of Natural Law theory. However, without further context or information on their specific ideas related to currency or economics, it is not possible to definitively attribute the statement "bad money drives out good" to any particular philosopher mentioned in the provided texts.  For a more accurate answer, I would need to refer to external sources on economics and the history of economic thought.

It won several awards, including the Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival in 1986.  However, if you're looking for a more specific answer, please let me know and I'll try to provide one based on available knowledge.

Jurisprudence is the theory or philosophy of law. It is concerned with the nature, purpose, and limits of law, as well as the relationship between law and society, politics, and morality.  More specifically, jurisprudence can be understood in several ways:  * As a philosophical inquiry into the fundamental principles and concepts that underlie the law * As a study of the history, development, and evolution of legal thought and institutions * As an examination of the role of law in society, including its relationship to power, justice, and human rights  In this sense, jurisprudence is a broad and multidisciplinary field that draws on insights from philosophy, sociology, politics, economics, and other social sciences to understand the complex dynamics of law and its impact on individuals and society.

According to various sources, including the Rapleaf Study and Quora, it's difficult to determine a single most common first name globally due to language and cultural differences. However, the Rapleaf study found that "Mohammed" is one of the most common first names worldwide but not in the top 100 on Facebook, likely due to variations in nicknames.  A more definitive answer comes from Quora, where an estimate suggests that "Zhang Wei" might be a strong contender for the most common full name globally. However, when it comes specifically to a single first name, there isn't a clear consensus or data-driven answer.  In Western cultures, names like "John," "Michael," and "James" are often cited as popular choices, but these may not hold up on a global scale.

The text discusses various explorers who sailed or traveled through different parts of North and Central America, but it does not mention a specific explorer who sailed around northern Canada through the Bering Strait in 1906.  However, I can provide some context about the Bering Strait. In 1908 (not 1906), Vilhjalmur Stefansson led an expedition that attempted to sail through the Bering Strait from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, but he was not successful. Another explorer, Roald Amundsen, completed a journey through the Northwest Passage in 1903-1907 and reached the Pacific Ocean via the northern coast of Canada.  It's possible that you are thinking of the expedition led by Vilhjalmur Stefansson or Roald Amundsen, but without more information, it is difficult to provide a specific answer.
