A nice math question!  To find the answer, we need to divide 1/9 (a ninth) by 1/3 (a third).  We can rewrite 1/9 as 3/27 and 1/3 as 9/27.  Now, dividing 3/27 by 9/27 gives us:  (3/27) ÷ (9/27) = 3/9  Simplifying the fraction, we get:  3/9 = 1/3  So, a ninth divided by a third is equal to one-third.

Based on my research, I couldn't find any information in the provided documents that links Anemone to Jesus Christ or associates it as an evergreen flowering climbing plant. However, I did find that Anemone is also known as Pasque Flower, which might be a clue.  The document "How to Grow Anemone Flowers" mentions that Anemones are native to the Mediterranean region and are commonly found in dry and rocky regions. One of the plants associated with Jesus Christ's resurrection is the Crocus or the Pasque Flower (Anemone), but it is not necessarily an evergreen flowering climbing plant.

I couldn't find any information in the provided documents that specifically mentions King John losing most of his Crown Jewels while crossing a body of water.

Based on my general knowledge, I can tell you that the story is likely based on the novel by Paul Scott, which explores the decline of the British Empire in India during World War II, particularly the aftermath of World War II.

A well-known story involving King John and a lost Crown Jewel is the story of the "Princess" (or "Pris"), which was said to have been lost by King John while he was crossing The Wash (a body of water in eastern England) on his way back from France.

It is possible that another manufacturer may have used the name "Molotov" or "Emka" (as mentioned in the document as an alternative name for the GAZ M1), but I couldn't find any information about British Leyland or Seat using these names.  If you provide more context or details, I might be able to help further.

However, the specific term "The Treasure of Dongo" actually refers to a collection of 13 gold crowns and some other looted items that were hidden away during World War II.   But one notable historical record does match your description: Victor Emmanuel III's son-in-law, Duke Umberto of Savoy, was not captured but another notable figure related to him, and a prominent leader in Italy, who did try to flee with gold and Ethiopian sovereigns, is Marshal Rodolfo Graziani's predecessor as the Italian Governor General of East Africa,  Amedeo, Duke of Aosta.

Unfortunately, I don't see any information in the provided documents that shows the current year. However, I can suggest a way to find out:  Since the document lists Chinese New Year dates for each year from 2005 to 2023, we can look at the date range and determine which year is currently being celebrated.  Assuming you're referring to 2023, according to the documents, Chinese New Year 2022 was on February 1, 2022, and Chinese New Year 2023 will be on January 22, 2023. Therefore, the current year (if we assume it's after January 22) would likely be a year represented by a different animal in the Chinese Zodiac.  However, I notice that the document lists a table "Chinese Years - Chinese Animal Years List" which includes years from 1900 to 2100, sorted according to the Chinese Animal they represent. Unfortunately, this list only goes up to 2026. To determine the current year, we would need more information or an updated list.  If you provide me with a specific date (month and day) or a range of dates for when the Chinese New Year occurred, I can help you identify the corresponding animal in the Chinese Zodiac.
