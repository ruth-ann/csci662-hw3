Unfortunately, the story doesn't specify which Hogwarts house Harry belonged to. However, based on his personality and behavior throughout the story, it seems likely that he would have been a Gryffindor, given their values of courage, determination, and willingness to challenge authority.

A furlong is a unit of distance used in horse racing. It is equal to 220 yards, or one-eighth of a mile.  There is no specific number of feet associated with a furlong, as it is typically measured in units of yards or miles.

According to Example 2, we can find one third of a number by dividing it by 3. Therefore, to find one third of 9 (which is a multiple of 3), we divide 9 by 3:   9 ÷ 3 = 3.  Since 1/3 of 9 is 3 and 1/9 of 9 is also 1, then:  1/9 ÷ 1/3 = (1 ÷ 9) / (1 ÷ 3)  Which simplifies to: 1/9 ÷ 1/3 = 1 ÷ (9 × 3) = 1 ÷ 27 = 1/27

But the correct answer to this question is actually not listed in the table.   After reviewing the tables provided, I can say that there isn't a single letter that is represented by just one dash in Morse Code.
This question doesn't relate to the provided text about Russian culture. The text appears to be a bibliography of sources related to Russian history and culture, rather than a culinary guide.

However, I don't see a question about the last line spoken in Macbeth. But I can answer that for you!  The last words of Macbeth are actually not spoken by a specific character, but rather by an unnamed Porter who says:  "Sleep no more! Macbeth does murder sleep— The innocent sleep, Sleep that knits up the ravelled sleave of care, The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath, Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, Unspher'd into a sea: There the grown agent sits, In reformation of the heav'nly ordinance; Sleep that the offenders sleep." - Macbeth Act 2 Scene 2  However, I believe you are asking about the last line spoken by a character in Macbeth. In this case, the last line is spoken by Lady Macbeth:  "Out, damned candle! smother it; Bed, to thee a thousand thanks, for that which benefits me shall do no harm unto my master."

However, based on general knowledge, I can tell you that as of 2017, China was indeed the largest producer of kiwifruit. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, in 2017, China produced over 2 million metric tons of kiwifruit, followed by Italy and then New Zealand.  Therefore, based on this information, it is likely that China was also the largest producer of kiwifruit in 2012.

The question doesn't relate to the given text about Russian culture. However, I can answer your math question:  The answer is: 9.  Explanation:  Let's say the number is x = ab (where a and b are its two digits). According to the problem, we have: x = 2(a+b).  We know that x = 10a + b. Substituting this into the equation above gives us: 10a + b = 2(a+b)  Distribute the 2 on the right side of the equation: 10a + b = 2a + 2b  Now, let's rearrange and simplify it: 10a - 2a = 2b - b 8a = b  As we can see, if a is equal to 9 (the only digit for which this works), then the number equals 99.

There is no mention of a British monarch being murdered at Berkeley Castle in September 1327 in the provided text. The text appears to be about European countries and their economic and political integration, and does not include any information about historical events or figures related to the British monarchy.  However, it's worth noting that Piers Gaveston was actually killed at Blacklow Hill in Buckinghamshire (not Berkeley Castle) in 1312 by a group of nobles led by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. And Edward II of England was indeed murdered at Berkeley Castle on September 28, 1327, after being deposed by the barons and nobles who were dissatisfied with his rule.  But to answer your question more directly: There is no mention of which specific British monarch was murdered at Berkeley Castle in the provided text.

Saturn is not correct as it's around 1.4 billion km from the Sun on average.  It's actually Saturn is around 1.43 billion kilometers away but that's the farthest in its orbit, and closest (perihelion) is about 1.35 billion km.  However, another planet with an average distance similar to what you mentioned is Uranus at approximately 2.88-4.55 billion km but more like Neptune which averages around 4.5 billion km away from the Sun but has a maximum of around 7 billion kilometers and minimum of about 4.5 billion.  However, none of those are close to the distance you provided in your question, I will take an educated guess based on common knowledge that another planet with approximately similar average orbital distance is not available

The answer is not related to the provided text. The correct answer is Arthur Ransome.  However, I can provide a brief analysis of the provided text, which appears to be a collection of articles on Holocaust revisionism:  * The articles presented various arguments and claims that challenge the traditional narrative of the Holocaust. * Some of the points raised include: 	+ Questioning the accuracy of survivor testimonies 	+ Challenging the notion that gas chambers were used at Auschwitz and other camps 	+ Pointing out apparent contradictions in official documents and records 	+ Suggesting that the scale of the Holocaust may be exaggerated or distorted * The authors, including Robert Faurisson and Paul Eisen, have been associated with the revisionist movement, which has been criticized for promoting conspiracy theories and denying the reality of the Holocaust. * It is worth noting that the vast majority of historians and scholars accept the established narrative of the Holocaust as based on credible evidence and research.  I would like to emphasize that these articles do not provide a balanced or neutral perspective on this topic. The debate around the Holocaust is complex, and opinions vary widely depending on individual perspectives, cultural contexts, and historical interpretations. It is essential to approach such topics with nuance and respect for different viewpoints while also being aware of the importance of accuracy and evidence-based research.

The three principles defined by Roman Vitruvius in the 1st century AD are:  * Firmitas (utility) - it should be useful and function well for the people using it * Utilitas (beauty) - it should delight people and raise their spirits.  Therefore, the art-form for which Roman Vitruvius defined these three principles is indeed Architecture.

Unfortunately, there's no specific mention of this question in the provided text.

This question doesn't seem to be related to the text provided about Alexander Graham Bell. The text is a biography of Bell's life and contributions, but it does not mention the Declaration of Independence or any reference to its signers.  However, I can provide some general information on this topic.

However, if I had to give a more specific answer based on common knowledge, I would say that the movement is likely the gay rights or LGBTQ+ movement.

The Law of Equal Areas: The line connecting a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. 3. The Law of Harmonies: The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis.

However, it seems that you are looking for information about King Alexander I. One possible candidate is Alexander I of Yugoslavia, who was assassinated in Marseille, France in 1934.

The main American tanks used during World War II were primarily based on designs from other countries, such as France and Britain. The M3 Stuart, M4 Sherman, and M24 Chaffee were some of the most widely used American tanks during the war.  However, if you're asking about an American-designed tank, one of the primary American tanks developed from scratch was the M26 Pershing, which entered service in late 1944. The M26 Pershing was a medium tank designed to counter the German Panther and Tiger tanks, and it became a significant part of the US armored forces.  But if I had to pick just one main American tank used during World War II, I'd say it's the M4 Sherman.

If you're looking for information on the city where the "first" public opera house was opened, I would suggest searching further or consulting a specific historical source about Russian cultural institutions and their founding dates.  However, based on general knowledge:  The answer could be St. Petersburg (then known as Leningrad), given its long history of hosting opera performances at the Hermitage Theatre.

A sudden change in topic!  The answer is: John Lennon.  However, I'll assume you're expecting me to summarize the previous text on the relationship between worship music and ancient cultures.  To provide a concise summary:  In ancient times, loud music and dance were often associated with idolatry and pagan rituals. The Bible warns against using such practices as worship. Instead, God desired a people who would silently listen to His message through His prophets or priests, such as Moses. This silence was meant to reflect reverence and attention to the divine word.  In fact, the Bible even outlaws loud music in some contexts (e.g., Numbers 10:7). Modern medicine has also discovered that loud music can disrupt rational thinking and stimulate emotions.  The text also touches on how sacrifices and feasts became associated with worship after a specific event at Mount Horeb (Exodus 32), where the people turned to idolatry.

Our question was "Which member of the Royal Family married Katharine Worsley in 1961?"  According to my knowledge and from this text, I can tell you that...
