According to the provided text, I couldn't find any information that specifically states who won the Wimbledon mixed doubles championship in 1981. However, I can suggest some possible steps to help answer this question.  The Bryan brothers (Bob and Mike) are mentioned as being part of a successful men's doubles team. They have 16 Grand Slams and an Olympic gold medal, but there is no information about them winning the Wimbledon mixed doubles championship in 1981.  However, I did find that John Newcombe and Betty Stöve won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title in 1966, and John Newcombe also won it again in 1970.

There is no mention of Lunar 10 in the provided text.

However, the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), which was a part of the Apollo program and used in conjunction with the LEM, had its name inspired by the Apollo 15 mission's commander, David Scott.  But if you are referring to another lunar module, it might be the Lunar Module "Snoopy" from Apollo 10. The Lunar Module was named after the popular Peanuts comic strip character Snoopy, who is also a Beagle.

I'm not sure if I can find an answer to this question.  However, based on general knowledge, it appears that "piano" is being used here as a slang term for something else.

But without more context about how this applies to cycling, I'm unsure if I can confirm that it is related to the terms provided from the text.

To determine the correct answer, we need to examine each option:  1. True: If this statement is true, then we should be able to find a number where two times the sum of its digits equals the number itself. 2. False: This would imply that there isn't any such number, which contradicts what we're looking for.  Let's proceed with finding an example that satisfies the given condition:  Consider the digit 9. Twice the sum of its digit is (2 x 9) = 18. The digit 8 plus the digit 1 makes 9. Hence, the correct answer to this problem is (9).

According to the text, Poseidon is married to Amphitrite and is associated with both horses and bulls as symbols, as well as being believed to cause earthquakes.  Poseidon is also listed among the 12 Olympian Gods in the provided text.  Therefore, the answer is:  **True**  Next, regarding the question about the god who has the horse and bull as symbols, causes earthquakes, and was married to Amphitrite:  The correct answer is **Poseidon**.

However, according to the novel "Wuthering Heights" by Emily Brontë, the waif Heathcliff is found and adopted by Mr. Earnshaw in Liverpool, but he later moves to Wuthering Heights, which is located in Yorkshire, England.  So, I would answer:  False: There is no specific city mentioned in the provided text as the location where Heathcliff is found and adopted.

**Answer:** True.  The question is asking whether the statement "For which art-form did Roman Vitruvius define the three principles of 'firmitas, utilitas, venustas' in the 1st century AD?" is true. The text actually says that "Architecture was the ""art which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by men ... that the sight of them"" contributes ""to his mental health, power, and pleasure"". However, it does mention that Vitruvius defined three principles (although not exactly in those words) for architecture: "Utility - it should be useful and function well for the people using it; Beauty - it should delight people and raise their spirits."  However, if we look closely, we can see that the text actually says:  "The great 19th century architect of skyscrapers, Louis Sullivan, promoted an overriding precept to architectural design: ""Form follows function"". While the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism, it had the effect of introducing the concept of ""function"" in place of Vitruvius' ""utility""."  But later on, we find:  "Utility - it should be useful and function well for the people using it; Beauty - it should delight people and raise their spirits."  So while "firmitas, utilitas, venustas" is close to what Vitruvius actually defined (the exact words used are "utility, beauty"), we can assume that the text meant to say architecture.  Therefore, the correct answer is True.

The answer is: True.  According to most Christian traditions, Deuteronomy is indeed considered the 5th book of the Torah (or Pentateuch), but in many Bibles, including the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions, it is sometimes referred to as a separate book from Joshua. However, according to most biblical scholars and theologians, Deuteronomy is not considered one of the 6 "books" often listed for the Old Testament.  A more likely answer would be:  The book of Job, Ecclesiastes, or perhaps Lamentations are sometimes considered to be among the final books in the Old Testament; however, it's worth noting that there isn't a commonly accepted 6th book of the Old Testament.

The answer to the question is:  **False**  The correct name of this mountain range is "Altai Mountains", not "Mountains of Gold". The Altai Mountains are a mountain system located in Southern Siberia, where Russia, China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan meet. They are indeed an important source of gold, but that's not what the name literally means.  The reason I chose False as the answer is because the question asks for the literal meaning of the name "Mountains of Gold", which is not accurate. The Altai Mountains have been a significant source of gold and other precious metals throughout history, but their name does not literally mean "Mountains of Gold" in Turkic or any other language.  The correct answer would be to identify the Altai Mountains as the mountain range that fits this description, rather than confirming the literal meaning of the name.

The correct answer is:  **TRUE**  When someone is said to "have green fingers," it means they are skilled and successful in gardening, horticulture, or anything related to plants. The phrase implies that they have a natural talent for growing and caring for plants, just as someone might have a knack for art or music.  Examples from the text support this:  * "Her garden is beautiful and if she gives me a plant which is green and lovely after being in my house for a while it starts dying. I promise, I have not green fingers." (Antonieta) * "My mother-in-law has got green fingers: everything she plants grow so well!" (Danh)  So, when someone "has green fingers," we expect them to be successful in gardening or plant-related activities!

This question does not relate to any information in the provided text.  However, based on general knowledge, I can provide an answer:  The correct answer is: The November Uprising (1830-1831) in Poland. The performance of Auber's opera "La Muette de Portici" at the Paris Opera House in August 1830 sparked a wave of patriotism among the Polish audience in Warsaw, leading to the outbreak of the November Uprising against Russian rule.  This event is indeed associated with the Romantic period mentioned in the text (1830-early 20th century).
According to the text, there is no information about a specific date being reserved for the inauguration of a President of the USA since the late 1930s.

The nearby towns of Salem Village (now Danvers) and other communities were actually at the center of the Salem Witch Trials.  Springfield, on the other hand, is more closely associated with its Puritan history, founding by William Pynchon, and significant events in American history, such as Shays' Rebellion and the construction of the first federal arsenal.

**There is no answer provided to this question.**  However, I can provide the information that you might be looking for:  In the UK, the heavily hyped end-November shopping day of mass brawling for bargains is commonly known as "Black Friday", although in recent years it has become a more organized and peaceful event.  Black Friday originated in the United States but has since been adopted by many retailers around the world, including in the UK. It typically takes place on the day after Thanksgiving Day in the US (which falls in late November) and is characterized by widespread sales and promotions at retail stores.  However, in recent years, Black Friday has become more of a marketing gimmick than an actual event of mass brawling for bargains. Many retailers have moved their sales online to avoid the chaos and long queues associated with traditional in-store shopping on this day.
