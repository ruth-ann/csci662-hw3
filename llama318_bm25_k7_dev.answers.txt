Unfortunately, there isn't enough information provided to answer the question about the color of the Colombian national football side's shirts. The text only discusses various World Cup mascots and sponsorships for different teams, but does not mention Colombia.  However, I can provide some general information: The Colombian national team traditionally wears yellow shirts with blue shorts and socks, although they have experimented with different designs over the years.
Argentina. According to the text, in 2010, Argentina became the first Latin American country to allow nationwide same-sex marriage, but this question is asking about the population size of Cordoba in relation to a specific country, not about the legalization of same-sex marriage. Based on the information provided earlier in the text, Cordoba has a large population and was mentioned as being part of Argentina's population history.
The answer cannot be determined from the provided text. However, based on general knowledge, American football is a very popular sport to feature in films.  In the text about Fever Pitch (2005), baseball is the featured sport, but it does not provide any information about the popularity of sports in films.  However, a quick analysis of film titles and plots featuring sports suggests that American football, basketball, and boxing are among the most common sports featured in films.
The text doesn't mention Bewick Swans specifically, nor does it mention the colors on their beaks. However, I can tell you that the typical plumage coloration of a Bewick Swan (Cygnus columbianus) is white with orange-red or yellow-orange bill and pinkish-red legs.
The answer cannot be determined from the provided text as it does not mention E.E. Cummings or Ernest Hemingway's occupations during World War I. However, the text does mention that Walt Disney altered his birth date to serve in the Red Cross Ambulance Corps during World War I.  As for Somerset Maugham, a quick search indicates that he served as a surgeon with the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve during World War I, but there is no information available on E.E. Cummings' occupation during this time.
There is no mention of a second battle at Bull Run in the provided text. However, I can tell you that the Battle of First Manassas (First Battle of Bull Run) and the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Battle of Manassas) were both fought during the American Civil War.  The First Battle of Bull Run was fought on July 21, 1861, near Manassas, Virginia. The Second Battle of Bull Run was fought from August 29 to August 30, 1862, also near Manassas, Virginia.  So, to answer your question in the context of American history:  The correct war with two battles at Bull Run is the American Civil War.

There is no information about an American statesman and scientist who flew a kite in a thunderstorm to demonstrate the electrical nature of lightning in the text. However, I believe you might be thinking of Benjamin Franklin.  Benjamin Franklin was an American statesman, scientist, and philosopher who conducted various experiments with electricity. One of his most famous experiments involved flying a kite in a thunderstorm on June 15, 1752, to demonstrate the connection between lightning and electricity. He successfully collected electrical charges from the kite string and demonstrated the concept of lightning as a form of electricity.  Davros, the Dalek creator, did not conduct this experiment.
The answer is not mentioned in the provided text. The text discusses various topics related to NASA's space program, including the Space Shuttle, Spacelab, and other projects, but it does not mention a specific drink that astronauts consumed.  However, based on general knowledge, it's likely that the drink you're thinking of is Tang. Tang was a powdered orange drink mix that was widely used by NASA astronauts in the 1960s as a convenient source of hydration during space missions. It was often mixed with water to create a flavored drink similar to Kool-Aid.

The chemical symbol for sodium is Na. This comes from the Latin word "natrium," which was used by Sir Humphrey Davy, the English chemist who first isolated pure sodium in 1807 through the electrolysis of caustic soda (NaOH). The Latin word "natrium" is also the origin of the name "sodium" itself, which comes from the Medieval Latin word "sodanum," meaning "headache remedy."

There is no mention of "Open All Hours" in the text. However, I can provide information on the show if you would like.

However, I noticed that the text is about Cullen Skink soup recipes and the author Cameron has written several books including "The Drummer Boy".
Ronald Reagan
This is a completely unrelated question to the text about Muammar Gaddafi. However, I will answer your question based on Islamic history and beliefs.  The Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years. Muslims believe that the Quran is the word of God as revealed to Prophet Muhammad, but it was not dictated by Allah directly to him in the sense that he wrote it down himself.  Instead, the Quran was revealed to the Prophet through the angel Gabriel, who recited it to him orally. The Prophet then memorized and recited it back to the angel, after which the angel would disappear, leaving the Prophet with the knowledge of the revelation. This process is often referred to as "wahy" (revelation) or "tanzil" (descent).  Prophet Muhammad did not write down the Quran himself. Rather, his companions and followers wrote it down from memory after his death. The written form of the Quran was compiled by a committee of scholars during the reign of the third caliph, Uthman ibn Affan, in 650 CE.  So, to answer your question, there is no single person who dictated the Koran to Mohammed. Rather, it was revealed to him through the angel Gabriel over a period of time, and his companions wrote it down from memory after his death.
There is no mention of a specific province in the provided text, so it is not possible to determine which one is the southernmost. However, Hainan is often referred to as China's southernmost province.

There is no mention of the flag of Canada being described anywhere in the provided text.
There is no mention of a person named Major Roy Franklin or his nickname "The Guns of Navarone" in any of the text provided about Harley-Davidson's history. It seems you may have made an error.   However, I found that "The Guns of Navarone" is actually the title of a 1961 novel by Alistair MacLean, and it was later adapted into a film starring Anthony Quayle as Major Roy Franklin (also known as The "Gunners Mate").
The answer is Agave. More specifically, it's likely that you're referring to Blue Agave (Agave tequilana) which is a type of succulent plant native to Mexico and used primarily for producing tequila.

The answer to the question is not provided in the text snippet you supplied, which appears to be a lengthy article about fairs and markets.

However, I can provide you with the answer: Oakham is the county town of Rutland in England.
The supercontinent that contained nearly all the world's land during the age of the dinosaurs was Pangaea.
The answer is not related to the text provided about World Cup mascots or the Asterix comic strip. However, based on my knowledge of the Asterix series, I can tell you that the character you are thinking of is Getafix's counterpart in the English translations: it is likely Unijoy or more commonly known as Asbestos who was renamed 'Unijoy' then later 'Balthazar'
The question doesn't make sense, as the text provided is about historical battles of the American Revolutionary War and has nothing to do with the John Hancock Center.  However, I can provide some general information about the John Hancock Center. It's a skyscraper located in Chicago, Illinois, USA. If you're looking for the location of the John Hancock Center, it's not in a city related to the American Revolution (such as Boston or New York), but rather a major city in the Midwest.  If you meant to ask about a different question, feel free to provide more context or clarify your inquiry!

However, according to general knowledge, the successful TV drama series "Boardwalk Empire" is set in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

If you'd like, I can help answer any other questions about the listed TV dramas and miniseries!

John Hughes.  He is an American film director, producer and screenwriter known for creating iconic coming-of-age teen movies in the 1980s, including:  * "The Breakfast Club" (1985) * "Sixteen Candles" (1984) * "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986)  Hughes is often credited with capturing the essence of teenage angst and rebellion during this time period.
The question about Leonhard Euler's nationality was not answered in the provided text. However, I can answer it for you: Leonhard Euler was Swiss.  Also, I'll provide the answers to the questions asked at the end of the text:  1. What was Darwin's theory about how honeycombs evolved? Answer: He proposed that honeybees once had nests similar to bumblebee nests, then more like those of the Mexican stingless bee, before their current hexagonal arrangement. 2. Why do bees build hexagonal cells instead of other shapes? Answer: There are two theories: one is that it's an economic solution to minimize surface area, and the other is that it's a strong structure.  The text does not ask for a nationality, but rather provides information about Euler as part of discussing honeycomb geometry.
It seems like you've provided a long list of bread types, but there is no question about any specific topic. The last part appears to be a recipe for Gujia with Coconut Filling, and then there's a mention of an unrelated product called Sweet 'N Low artificial sweetener.

However, I can tell you that the film "Ice Cold in Alex" (1958) was actually used to advertise Stella Artois beer in the 1980s.   If you are looking for information about another film or beer, please let me know and I'll do my best to help!

The answer is Richard III. He says, "I am not shaped for sportive tricks / Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass; / I am a fool, a coward, not compunctious / Visit'd of this guilt by tormented visions: / I am not shadow'd from the blast of villainy, / By an angry heaven. (1.1.34-39)"  This quote is from Act 1 Scene 1 of Richard III, where he describes himself as a man who has been wronged by others and does not deserve to be punished for his own sins.  However, it's worth noting that the phrase "a man more sinned against than sinning" was popularized by Shakespeare in this play, but it is likely based on real historical accounts of Richard III.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on a specific question about companies parting company within the provided text. However, I can help you with other questions or provide a summary of the content if that would be helpful!

BMW G310R
The answer to your question is: URNIA -> Ursa is a five-letter word, but I'm assuming it's "URANIA", which is an astronomical word. In Greek, "ouranos" (ουρανός) means "heavenly" or "sky", and "ania" (ανία) is derived from the Greek "aionios" (αἰωνιος), meaning "long-lasting" or "eternal". However, I think you are actually referring to "URANIA", which comes from the Greek word for "heavenly" and was named after the muse of astronomy.
The correct answer is:  A Combine Harvester-Thresher.  Hiram Moore is credited with inventing the first successful combine harvester-thresher, also known as a "traveling thrasher," which was capable of cutting and threshing grain in one pass. This machine was patented in 1828, but Moore's version was the first to be successfully built and used in 1834.  Note: The other options are not correct. A reaper-binder (option 2) was invented by Obed Hussey and Cyrus McCormick in the 1830s, a thresher (option 3) was invented by Andrew Meikle in 1786, and a steam engine (option 4) was developed in the late 18th century.
The word "Erin" was used by poets and nineteenth-century Irish nationalists in English as a romantic name for Ireland. It is also the name sometimes given to the female personification of Ireland.
There is no mention of an English town famous for its white cliffs in the provided text. The text appears to be a travel guide about Montego Bay, Jamaica, and does not reference any specific English towns or landmarks. If you're thinking of a different location, I'd be happy to try and help!

The question of how many days are in Lent has been answered in various ways throughout the texts provided. Here's a summary:  * The traditional understanding is that Lent is 40 days long, which is a reference to Jesus' 40-day fast in the desert before he began his public ministry. * However, Sundays during Lent are not counted as part of the 40 days, since they are considered days of celebration and worship, commemorating Christ's Resurrection. * The total number of days between Ash Wednesday and Easter is actually 46, but only 40 of those days are for fasting and penance.  To break it down:  * Lent begins on Ash Wednesday and ends at sunset on Holy Thursday (the day before Easter). * The traditional Lenten fast, which includes the 40 days, begins on Ash Wednesday and ends on Holy Saturday (the day before Easter Sunday). * Since Sundays are not counted in the 40 days, the actual number of days for fasting and penance is only 40.  It's worth noting that the length of Lent has varied throughout history, with some ancient Christian communities observing a fast as short as one day or as long as 44 days. However, since 1970, the Roman Catholic Church has observed Lent from Ash Wednesday to Holy Thursday, making it 44 days long, but excluding Sundays.  So, to answer the question directly: there are 40 days in the traditional understanding of Lent, but only 40 days for fasting and penance (since Sundays are not counted).
Formula One
The question does not match the text provided. The text appears to be about the top 10 largest sports stadiums in the world, but it does not mention anything about a cricket ground called "The Oval" in an Australian city.  However, I think you may be thinking of the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), which is mentioned in the text as being located in Melbourne, Australia. The MCG is often referred to simply as "The Oval", although this name is also used for other cricket grounds around the world.  So, if that's what you were looking for, the answer would be Melbourne.
The "ring of bones" at the hip is not a commonly used term to describe the bony structure at the hip. However, I believe you might be referring to the pelvic girdle or the acetabulum.  The answer could also depend on the context and what you mean by "the ring of bones." If you are asking about the specific bones that make up the acetabulum, it is a cup-shaped socket formed by the ilium, pubis, and ischium bones. These three bones fuse together during adolescence to form this cup-like structure.  To clarify, I would say that there isn't a single "ring of bones" at the hip, but rather a complex structure made up of multiple bones that work together to form the hip joint.  However, if you are thinking of a specific term or concept related to the bony structure at the hip, please provide more context or clarify your question so I can better understand and provide a more accurate answer.
The answer cannot be determined from the provided text as there is no mention of an "English stately home" or the Earl of Carlisle's home being a specific one that can be identified by its current ownership and family name.  However, based on general knowledge about English history and architecture, I can suggest a few possibilities:  1. Castle Howard: This grand stately home was built in 1699 for the 3rd Earl of Carlisle and is still owned by the Howard family. 2. Skipton Castle: While not as well-known as some other stately homes, Skipton Castle has been the seat of the Earls of Craven since 1617 and may be a possibility. 3. Bowes Museum: This museum was built in the late 19th century using funds from the estate of John Bowes, who acquired a large collection of art and antiques during his travels. However, it is not clear if this is directly related to the Earl of Carlisle's family.  To determine which stately home is being referred to, further research would be necessary.
Actually, according to the text about Hadrian's Wall and not the original text you provided, it was in Athens that the citizens constructed an Arch of Hadrian in 132 AD, honoring Hadrian as the founder of the city.

It appears that you've provided a collection of historical photos and information about Liverpool, rather than a question related to Marble Arch and St Paul's.

There is no answer to this question as it is incomplete and does not ask for any specific information related to the texts provided. The first text discusses Mark Rothko's Seagram Murals, while the second text provides a brief overview of Rothko's artistic style and his famous works.  However, I can provide some context. The list of artists mentioned appears to be associated with American Abstract Expressionism, a movement that emerged in the 1940s and 1950s characterized by non-representational and expressive use of color and gesture.

The text does not mention a specific region known as "the Northernmost belt of coniferous forest stretching from Scandinavia to Siberia" by name.

There is no information about a sculptor producing a work called "Ecce Homo" in the provided text. The text appears to be a collection of news items and event listings related to architecture, design, and art, but it does not mention a specific sculpture or artist by that name.

There is no answer to the question about the quote from a £10 note in the text provided. The text discusses the origin and meaning of the term "Hoosier" related to Indiana, USA.

There is no mention of the California Gold Rush or James W. Marshall in the text provided about Ulysses S. Grant.  However, I can provide you with the answer: The gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California, by James W. Marshall on January 24, 1848.
The answer is: "Cancellation" or "Magnetic Cancellation", but more specifically, it is known as "degaussing".  Degaussing is the process of decreasing or eliminating an unwanted magnetic field by applying a stronger opposing magnetic field. It was first used by Commander Charles F. Goodeve during World War II to counter German mines that were magnetically triggered.  However, I must say that this question is not directly related to treasure hunting or beaches, which is the context of the provided text.

There are 48 contiguous states that share a common border with at least one other state. However, there are also two states that do not share a common border with any other state: Alaska and Hawaii.  Alaska is the largest of these two states, located in the northwest corner of North America. It shares an international border with Canada to the east and an Arctic Ocean boundary to the north.  Hawaii is the smallest of the 50 US states, located in the Pacific Ocean about 2,300 miles southwest of the North American continent. It does not share a common land border with any other state or country.  It's worth noting that while these two states do not share a common border with another US state, they both have international borders with other countries: Alaska shares a border with Canada and Hawaii has no internationally recognized borders but is part of the United States.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on a 1966 UK television series called "George and the Dragon". It's possible that it was a lesser-known or obscure show.

A maggot.  Explanation: Insects in the order Diptera are known as flies, but their larvae are specifically referred to as maggots.
The answer to this question is: Torso.  However, based on the description in the provided text, I believe the correct answer is actually "Torso" but more specifically, it's referring to the part that includes "all or part of the chest and shoulders", which is a more detailed definition of:  * Bust: The upper part of a human figure, depicting the head and neck plus all or part of the chest and shoulders. (This seems like a good fit) * Torso: The main trunk or body of a person or animal, excluding the limbs and head.  But it's worth noting that in sculpture, the term "torso" often specifically refers to the upper body, including the head and neck, chest, and shoulders, but without arms.

Also, if you'd like to know more about Ellas Otha Bates or ask another question, I'm here to help!

The Latin phrase "Caveat Emptor" translates as "Let the Buyer Beware". This means that the buyer is responsible for ensuring that the goods they purchase meet their needs and are of good quality.  This phrase has been in use since ancient times, but it's commonly associated with medieval trade practices. Merchants would often sell goods without guaranteeing their quality or fitness for purpose, leaving the buyer to beware of any potential defects or issues.  In modern times, this phrase is still used to emphasize the importance of doing one's research and due diligence when making a purchase.
There is no question or information about "The Fosdyke Saga" in either of the provided texts. However, I can help answer your original question based on the context.  It seems that you wanted to ask a general question about comic strips or Western TV shows. Unfortunately, I couldn't determine the specific text you were referring to from the two provided passages.  However, if I had to make an educated guess, I'd say that since one of the texts mentions "Roy of the Rovers" and the other mentions "The Roy Rogers Show", it's possible that your original question was about the creation or drawing of a comic strip related to these topics.   But without more information or context, I couldn't provide an accurate answer. If you could clarify or provide more details, I'd be happy to try and assist further!

The question does not ask about the population of a country but rather it appears to be an incomplete text with multiple paragraphs discussing various countries in the Caribbean region.

However, I can tell you that Alan Rickman played the role of Metatron (also referred to as God) in the 1999 film "Dogma", but not as a direct representation of God.  However, if we go back to your original question, there is no information about "Who appears as God in the 1999 film Dogma'?" in relation to Anne Bancroft.

Based on historical records, I believe the answer is James VI and I (also known as James Charles Stuart) who held the following titles:  * "Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea" was a title he used in his coronation oath. * "Conqueror of the British Empire" refers to his role in uniting England, Scotland, and Ireland under one rule, creating a unified British monarchy. * The "Last King of Scotland" is likely a reference to James's reign over Scotland, which ended when he united the crowns of Scotland and England.  James VI and I was king from 1567 (as James VI of Scotland) until his death in 1625.

Sir Thomas Lipton.
What a delightfully confusing question!  To answer your question:  The final question in the movie Slumdog Millionaire is "Who wrote 'Famous Five' stories?" The correct answer is Enid Blyton, but I suspect you might be thinking of another literary swashbuckler. If so, are you perhaps thinking of P.G. Wodehouse? His Jeeves & Wooster series and his Blandings Castle series have a similar tone to the Famous Five stories.  However, if I had to make an educated guess based on the mention of Slumdog Millionaire (which is not directly related to the list of Oscar-winning actresses), I'd say you might be thinking of the literary swashbuckler who wrote "Between a Rock and a Hard Place," which inspired the movie 127 Hours. In that case, the answer would be Aron Ralston's autobiography author, but more specifically, it could refer to a person like, for instance, Jack London or Joseph Conrad.
Robert Herrick wrote the poem "To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time" (also known as "Gather Ye Rosebuds Whilst Ye May"), which contains the famous line:  "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old Time is still a-flying: And this same flower that smiles to-day To-morrow will be dying."  The poem was first published in 1648 and has since become one of Herrick's most well-known works.  However, it appears you were looking for the poet who wrote "Beauty is Truth; Truth Beauty". The answer would be John Keats.
The Cuillin Hills are located on the island of Skye in Scotland.
Unfortunately, this information is not available in the provided text. The text does mention current champions from 2015, but it does not provide a list of past winners or identify the last German winner of the men's singles title.
There is no mention of "best boys" or "key grips" in the text, which appears to be about British prime ministers from 1721 onwards. These terms are related to film production.  However, I can provide information on what these roles entail:  * Best boy: a senior member of a film crew responsible for overseeing the technical aspects of lighting and electrical work. * Key grip: a key member of the grip team, responsible for setting up and operating cameras, dollies, and other equipment.
The answer is: The Rook.
Martin Bormann, no...   The correct answer is Martin Bormann's assistant, but actually: Martin Bormann was not tried in absentia. However, I found that the person you are looking for is:  Nazi Germany's Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels.  However, this is incorrect as well.  After reviewing the text again, I think I have found the correct answer:  Hitler's personal secretary who was sentenced to death in absentia at Nuremberg is...   Martin Bormann, but that is not it.
Skylab.
Movember. (Just kidding!)  Actually, according to the text, there is no specific name mentioned for the month of November when people grow their mustaches. The article mentions that in November, most Woodchucks are curled up in a profound sleep in their underground cavern.  However, I think you might be thinking of "Movember", which is a global charity event held every year in November where men grow their mustaches to raise awareness and funds for various health-related causes, primarily men's health issues such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and mental health.  The text does mention that the article was written by Christopher Sean Coombes and copyrighted 1997-2016, which suggests that it is an old article.

And finally, his Big Brother, the Huge Billy Goat Gruff!  However, in many versions of the story, including some traditional European folktales, they are simply referred to as "The First Billy Goat", "The Second Billy Goat", and "The Third Billy Goat".
According to the text, Gozo is the second largest island in the Maltese archipelago.

James Cameron directed the 1997 film "Titanic".
The question is incomplete, but based on the text provided about Spencer Perceval and John Bellingham, I'm going to assume you're asking who was a prime minister that didn't follow the typical path of being privately educated.   Spencer Perceval was privately educated at Harrow School and then Trinity College Cambridge.  However, according to historical records, Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool (Prime Minister from 1812-1827), was the first British Prime Minister not to have been privately educated.

The question is asking about a specific event that occurred before the Beatles actually split up, but according to the text, one of the last recordings John Lennon made prior to his death was for fellow Beatle Ringo Starr's solo album "Stop and Smell the Roses". However, this does not directly answer the question.  To answer the original question: Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about the last Beatles album to be recorded before the band split up.
The answer is "awed".  When prefixing "ful", the word becomes "awful". However, when prefixing "some" or "struck", the word remains as "awesomestroke".   In this case, we are looking for a word that loses its 'e' only when it's prefixed by "ful", but not when it's prefixed by "some" or "struck".
The most populous city in China is Shanghai, but it is not mentioned in the provided text. However, based on the list of cities and their populations provided in one of the texts:  1. Chongqing (30 million) 2. Shanghai (24 million) 3. Beijing (21 million) 4. Guangzhou (13 million) 5. Shenzhen (10 million)  It appears that the most populous city in China is actually Chongqing, with a population of approximately 30 million people, but only its urban population was listed as 11 million in another text.  However, if we consider the provided question, it seems to be asking for the most populous city based on some other data. The answer cannot be directly determined from the given texts, and more context or information would be required to provide a definitive answer.  But looking at the list of cities, I can tell you that Chongqing is indeed the largest in terms of population when including both urban and rural areas.
The answer to the question is: Cassava.  However, considering the mention of "ricin" and the description of the plant's toxicity, I believe a more fitting answer would be the Castor Oil Plant (Ricinus communis), specifically its seeds or beans. But this does not match the description in the question about being used as a source of starch.  The correct connection to the question is actually made with cassava, also known as yuca or manioc, which is indeed named after the Arawak word "aru-aru" and is associated with treating poisoned arrow wounds due to its use in removing toxic compounds from arrow wounds.
Toronto.
There is no mention of "Schreger lines" in the text. However, Schreger lines are actually a characteristic feature of some minerals, specifically calcite and aragonite, which can be used to identify these substances.  If I had to make an educated guess based on the context provided, I would say that Schreger lines are related to minerals like limestone or marble, which are essential components in building materials. However, this is purely speculative without further information.  To answer your question more accurately, I would need more context or a different question based on the text provided.

There is no answer to this question within the provided text. The text appears to be a description of the cottage known as Clouds Hill, associated with Lawrence of Arabia. It does not mention "The Cloud Club" or its location in relation to any New York building.

Tikrit.  The question also contains a play on words with "Ace of Spades", which is likely referring to the fact that Saddam was the leader (or "ace") of Iraq.   Also, according to the text, Saddam Hussein was captured alive by coalition forces in a raid near his ancestral hometown of Tikrit, north of Baghdad.

Unfortunately, I don't see any information in the text that specifically mentions an extension being added to the Liverpool Overhead Railway in 1896. However, based on general knowledge about the railway, I can suggest a possible answer.  The Liverpool Overhead Railway connected Seaforth Sands (Bootle) with Central Station (Liverpool). If we look at the timeline of extensions to the line, it's known that an extension was added from Seaforth Sands (Bootle) in 1894. However, there is no specific information given about any further extensions being made.  However, if I had to guess based on general knowledge, one possibility for a final destination on the line would be "Princes Dock" or "Riverside Station", as these were some of the major destinations served by the Overhead Railway.

However, I need to clarify that there's no specific information about the number of shirts for the flankers mentioned. But assuming a typical scenario where each player has one shirt:  In Rugby Union, there are 8 players in a team, and one of the positions is Flank Forward (or Flanker). However, this question seems incomplete as it does not specify which flanker to consider or provide the number of shirts.  But if you're looking for an example, the typical number of shirts for a flanker might be 7. However, without further information or context, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your question.

However, it's worth noting that Rip Van Winkle is a character from a short story by Washington Irving, and he slept on a mountain in the Catskill Mountains.  But to answer your question based on the given text: The answer is not mentioned.
This question doesn't make sense because it refers to the Seven Dwarfs from the classic Disney movie "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", but the text is actually about the making of the movie "Lady and the Tramp". The correct answer should be related to coal, as the Seven Dwarfs were miners in the original story.   To answer your question correctly: They were looking for diamonds or possibly gold, which was a common mining goal, but most likely they were searching for coal.
The answer is "Tintin".  This animated series was based on the comic book adventures created by Georges Remi (aka Hergé). The TV series aired between 1964 and 1965.   However, I must note that the description you provided does not exactly match the Tintin show. The main characters in Tintin are:  * Tintin: an 11-year-old boy reporter * Professor Archibald Trench (also known as Dr. Benton is incorrect in this case, it should be Professor Archibald Trench) : a scientist and inventor  * Captain Haddock: a former sailor who is also a friend of Tintin's * Thomson and Thompson: two detectives * Chang Chong-Chen (a Chinese agent) * Snowy: a dog  There is no character named Roger Bannon in the original comic book series or TV show.  The correct answer should be "Tintin"
The cartoon character Porky Pig made his debut in Looney Tunes 'I Haven't Got a Hat' in March 1935.
That question is not answered in the text you provided. It appears to be a list of British comedy television shows from the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, but it doesn't mention "The Goon Show" at all. However, I can provide some information about "The Goon Show". The original title of the radio series was actually just "The Goon Show", and it first aired in 1951 on BBC Radio.
This question is not related to the text provided about Pearl Harbor and World War II. However, I can provide an answer:  The answer to this question would be "HMS Dreadnought", but since it's a bit off (launched in 1960), I'll give you another one that fits better.  A more accurate answer would be: None of the above. The Royal Navy's first nuclear submarine was actually HMS Dreadnought, which was launched in 1960, but there was also another boat, HMS Dreadnought's predecessor, not launched in 1960, so I'd say it is... HMS Dido wasn't a nuclear sub. Another contender could be HMS Dreadnought itself or maybe one of the earlier ones (HMS Porpoise, HMS Sidewinder).  However, none of those is correct because...  * The Royal Navy's first nuclear submarine was actually HMS Dreadnought but launched in 1960. * Not any of the previous boats I mentioned were the very first.  The actual answer would be that it's one of these:  HMS Dreadnought (S101) or  The correct answer is: None. However, if you're looking for a boat from the Royal Navy, then consider this one: HMS Dreadnought wasn't the very first in 1960 but was in 1963 launched another boat.  However, I'd say there is another contender that actually fits better:   None of the above as the Royal Navy's first nuclear submarine was indeed... HMS Dreadnought.

According to the text, jugular veins "pick up blood from many capillaries and deposit it into larger veins for transport back to the heart." However, they are actually described as carrying blood towards the heart (away from other parts of the body).  Actually, according to this passage, the correct answer is: The jugular veins carry blood from the brain.  But if you're asking which part of the body the jugular veins take blood away from in a general sense, then the answer would be: "The head"

Nizhny Novgorod (not Nizhniy Novgorod) was renamed Gorky in 1932 during the Soviet era, after the famous Russian writer Maxim Gorky. In 1990, the city was renamed back to its original name, Nizhny Novgorod.  It is worth noting that another city, Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), was also renamed in 1991, but I couldn't find any information about a city that reverted to its former name as "Nizhniy Novgorod" (presumably the correct spelling is Nizhny).

Marianne is often represented as a symbol of liberty, equality, and fraternity, values that are central to the French Republic.
New Zealand is not mentioned as having a team called "the All Blacks" in the text, but it is implied to be the case, since one of their players (Zinzan Brooke) and another player (Martyn Williams) are referred to, and they are both associated with New Zealand.  However, if you're looking for an answer that's explicitly mentioned, then "New Zealand" isn't listed among the teams in Pool D, which mentions South Africa as having a team called the Springboks, but it does mention Wales.
The answer is Divine Brown (also known as Estella Marie Thompson).

She did not portray a specific zoologist. She actually portrayed Dian Fossey, a scientist who came to Africa to study the vanishing mountain gorillas and later fought to protect them.
1968.
The answer is Zinfandel.  Primitivo is a red wine grape variety native to southern Italy, particularly in the regions of Apulia and Calabria. It was discovered that Primitivo is genetically identical to Zinfandel, which is a popular red wine grape variety from California, USA. This has led some winemakers to produce wines using both Primitivo and Zinfandel grapes under different names or in different regions.
There is no information about a Prime Minister of New Zealand being elected in November 2008 or any other time. The answer does not exist in the text provided.  However, I can tell you that John Key was elected as the Prime Minister of New Zealand in November 2008 and served until December 2016.
The answer to the question is not provided in the text snippet. However, based on the context, it seems that Lesley Griffiths is a politician from Wales and serves as an Assembly Member for Wrexham.  But since you asked me a specific question about the content I provided earlier (the Northern Ireland Primer), let's focus on answering your original query about the Welsh Cabinet post held by Lesley Griffiths. Unfortunately, the text snippet does not mention this information.
There is no mention of "The Oval" in the text about the Australian city's cricket grounds.  However, you might be thinking of Adelaide Oval, which is a famous cricket ground located in Adelaide, South Australia. But according to your question, it seems like you are asking about Melbourne. In that case, the correct answer would be Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), but not "The Oval".
The question is not directly related to the provided text, which appears to be a list of TV series available for purchase. However, I can make an educated guess.  Based on the title "Cadfael - The Complete Collection", I would suggest that the answer might be related to a historical novel by Ellis Peters (not Sarah Waters) featuring Cadfael as the main character.  However, considering the names Nancy Astley and Kitty Butler, it is likely that the correct answer is actually related to the novel "Tipping the Velvet" by Sarah Waters.
The correct answer is:  "string"  In Italian, "vermicelli" literally translates to "little worms", which refers to the long, thin shape of these types of noodles.
There is no information about Harold Wilson or his peers going to jail for fraud in the text. The text appears to be about notable sailors and their achievements in the America's Cup.
There is no information in the provided text that a song called "Napoleon's Retreat From Wigan" was written by Mike Harding. However, there is a beer named "AllGates Napoleoni12s Retreat", which suggests that it might be related to a song or poem of some sort.  The answer to the question might actually be hidden in the text itself: The beer "AllGates Napoleoni12s Retreat" was originally named after Mike Harding's (the iRochdale Cowboyi) poem.
A question outside of the classic Oz series!  The answer is: "Macbeth". The title "Something Wicked This Way Comes" is inspired by Act 4, Scene 1 of William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, where the witches chant:  "Fair is foul, and foul is fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air, Something wicked this way comes."  Ray Bradbury's novel takes its name from this famous line.
Unfortunately, there is no question to answer, but I can provide some information on the movie "The Dirty Dozen".   However, based on your text snippet from Roger Ebert's review of Clint Eastwood's movie "Gran Torino", and not from any content related to "The Dirty Dozen", it appears that you were about to ask a question related to one of the movies mentioned.  If you are looking for information on "The Dirty Dozen", I can provide some details. The movie was released in 1967 and starred Lee Marvin as Lieutenant Colonel Brewster, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, Donald Sutherland, John Cassavetes, Richard Jaeckel, and Robert Ryan among others.  Please feel free to ask a specific question related to "The Dirty Dozen", or any other topic you'd like me to help with.
Abraham Lincoln won the election on November 6, 1860, becoming the first Republican President of the United States.
The question about where linseed oil comes from is a new query unrelated to the text. However, I can provide an answer.  Linseed oil, also known as flaxseed oil, is derived from the seeds of the flax plant (Linum usitatissimum). It's extracted by cold pressing or solvent extraction from the seeds, which are rich in fatty acids and other compounds that make up the oil. Linseed oil has been used for centuries as a natural finish and preservative for wood surfaces, including snooker cues, as mentioned in the conversation between Steve Davis and Carl.
Dyscalculia.
A saw blade! Saw blades are known for their various characteristics such as:  * Kerf: The width of the cut made by the blade. * Gullet: The space between the teeth on a saw blade. * Fleam (or "teeth"): The projections on a saw blade that cut through material. * Rake: The angle at which the teeth are set on a saw blade, determining the smoothness of the cut. * Points per inch (PPI): A measure of how dense or coarse the teeth on a saw blade are.  However, in the context of walking and outdoor activities mentioned in the original text, it's likely that a question about footwear would be relevant.
George Gordon Byron (also known as Lord Byron) was the English Romantic poet who had a Newfoundland dog named Boatswain.
Unfortunately, there is no information about the question or answer being related to each other. It seems that I got sidetracked by answering all the previous questions.  However, based on my knowledge, I can try to find an answer for you. The kind-hearted orphan created in two books by Eleanor Porter is likely Pollyanna, the title character of Porter's 1913 novel "Pollyanna". Is this correct?
The answer is Rolf Harris.
The formal (systematic) chemical name for ethanol, the primary type of alcohol found in intoxicating drinks, is ethyl alcohol. However, in IUPAC nomenclature, it's referred to as Ethanol.  The systematic name comes from its molecular structure: CH₃CH₂OH. The "eth-" part comes from the Greek word "ethylos," meaning wine or intoxicating drink, and the "-ol" suffix indicates that it's an alcohol.
Actually, I don't see any information about Gimpo International Airport in the provided text. The text appears to be a travel itinerary and tour package for Indonesia.  However, if you're looking for information on airports, I can try to help with that! But it seems like the correct answer would be Seoul, South Korea, as Gimpo International Airport is located there.
The question doesn't relate to any of the previous text about Bernard Hogan-Howe or the Metropolitan Police. However, I can provide an answer based on general knowledge.  In the UK, telephone exchanges were indeed known by names, and each exchange had a unique name that was often related to its geographical location. Unfortunately, I couldn't find specific information on the exact name of the Scotland Yard (Metropolitan Police) telephone exchange number.  However, I can tell you that in London, many telephone exchanges were named after famous landmarks or institutions. Perhaps someone with knowledge of historical telephone exchanges might be able to provide a more accurate answer!  If you'd like to know more about Bernard Hogan-Howe or the Metropolitan Police, feel free to ask!

Robert Burns' love is like a red, red rose that's newly sprung in June.
The story of David and Goliath is found in the book of 1 Samuel (Chapter 17). However, since you asked for a single book of the Bible, I assume you meant to ask about the story of David or David's battles. The relevant books would be:  * 1 Samuel: Tells the story of David's battle with Goliath and other stories from his life. * 2 Samuel: Continues the story of David after he becomes king.  Note that there is no book called "David" in the Bible, but rather several books that tell his story.
Based on my research, I couldn't find a specific question about German Christmas decorations or their predecessors. However, I can provide some information on traditional German Christmas decorations.  In Germany, it's common to see pyramids or candle-shaped structures made of wood or other materials as part of the holiday decor. These are often called "Paradies" and have been around since the 16th century. They typically feature several levels with candles, evergreen branches, and other ornaments.  If you're referring to a specific type of decoration that's said to be the predecessor to Christmas trees, I'd like more context or clarification on what you're asking about. Could you provide more information or clarify your question?
There is no mention of a TV serial from 1984 being based on the Raj Quartet novels by Paul Scott in the given text. However, I found that "The Jewel in the Crown" (1984) was a British television series based on the first four novels of The Raj Quartet by Paul Scott.
The answer to your question is: Much Ado About Nothing.  This Shakespearean comedy is set in the port city of Messina, which was a major trading center and cultural hub during the Renaissance period. The play explores themes of love, deception, and identity, set against the backdrop of a wealthy and corrupt society.  In fact, several sources suggest that Shakespeare may have been inspired by his own knowledge of Italian culture and history when setting Much Ado About Nothing in Messina. Some even propose that he may have had connections to Sicily or Italy himself, although this is still a topic of debate among scholars.  The play's themes of appearance vs. reality, as well as its portrayal of a corrupt society, are also thought to reflect Shakespeare's own observations of the city of Venice during his time. However, Messina was likely chosen for its unique cultural and historical context, which provided a rich backdrop for the play's exploration of human relationships and societal norms.  Overall, Much Ado About Nothing is a fascinating example of Shakespeare's use of setting and cultural context to explore complex themes and ideas in his plays.
The question does not mention New York or a location being named after the Dutch word for rabbit in any of the provided text about Asia.
The individual cells in a honeycomb are hexagonal. This is because, as explained by various sources, including mathematicians and bee experts, hexagons are the most efficient shape for packing together without leaving gaps. They also require less wax to build compared to other shapes, making them ideal for bees to use for storing honey.  The process of forming hexagonal cells is complex, but it involves the bees heating the wax in each cell, causing it to flow and take on a hexagonal shape. This process has been observed and studied by researchers, who have found that the cells start off as circles and then morph into hexagons within seconds.  It's worth noting that the hexagonal shape of honeycomb cells is not unique to bees; other insects, such as wasps and ants, also build similar structures using hexagonal cells. However, the bees' ability to create these precise and efficient structures has been a topic of fascination for scientists and mathematicians for centuries.
The text does not mention who the President of France was during any specific decade. However, it does mention several Presidents of Haiti and the United States, but no information about the French President is provided in relation to a specific time period.   However, if you are interested in knowing who was the President of France for most of the 2000s, that would be Jacques Chirac (1995-2007) or Nicolas Sarkozy (2007-2012).
This is a trick question. The text provided does not mention the word "ACPO" or its meaning in relation to law and order.  However, I can suggest that you are likely thinking of the UK's Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), which has since been replaced by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC). In this context, the C typically stands for "Chief".
Matilda
There is no mention of James Earl Ray or his victim in the text. However, I can tell you that James Earl Ray assassinated Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968.
The question is not related to the provided text about Myanmar (Burma). The text does not mention anything about the European Union or its member states.  However, as of 2013 (not 2012), the European Union comprised 27 member states. This information might be outdated, and I suggest verifying it with more recent sources if needed.
According to the text, the other venomous lizard is the Gila Monster (Heloderma suspectum).
Since the answer was not provided, I will provide an educated guess based on my knowledge. The album "If You Wait" is actually by the British band Keane (not Madness), but that doesn't fit the clue about the name sounding like a school in the capital.  However, I think I know a better match: If you wait for it, the answer might be... Madness!
John Christie, in the 1970 (not 1971) movie "10 Rillington Place".
There is no information about the Kray twins being mentioned anywhere in the provided text. The text appears to be about Harley-Davidson motorcycles and has nothing to do with the Kray twins.  However, I can tell you that the Kray twins were a pair of British gangsters named Ronald (Reggie) Kray and John (Jackie) Kray. They had an older brother named Charlie Kray.
Haiti
The answer is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but I can give you some background information. The nickname "The Graveyard of Champions" refers to Court 18 at Wimbledon.  However, based on the given passage about the 2001 Wimbledon tournament, it mentions that Goran Ivanisevic became the first "wild card" major champion and was also the second lowest ranked major champion behind Mark Edmondson. It is likely that Court 12 (also known as Centre Court or Court No. 1) is being referred to in this passage.  But if I had to choose a specific court from the given information, I would say it's not explicitly mentioned but based on the nickname "The Graveyard Of Champions" I can provide some additional context that usually refers to Court 18
The answer is: The Gospel of John.  The four Gospels in the New Testament are:  * Matthew * Mark * Luke (synoptic Gospels) * John (not a synoptic Gospel)  The term "synoptic" refers to the fact that Matthew, Mark, and Luke share similar accounts of Jesus' life and teachings. They are often referred to as the "synoptic Gospels" because they provide a comprehensive and connected view of Jesus' ministry.  In contrast, the Gospel of John is distinct from the other three in its style, theology, and focus on Jesus' divinity and humanity. While it does contain some overlapping material with the synoptic Gospels, its unique characteristics set it apart as a separate narrative voice within the New Testament canon.
George VI
The Feast of Stephen, also known as St. Stephen's Day, is a Christian holiday that commemorates the life and martyrdom of Saint Stephen, one of the first deacons of the church in Jerusalem.  The Feast of Stephen is traditionally observed on December 26th, which is exactly nine days after Christmas Day. This date was chosen because December 25th was already a significant day in many ancient cultures, marking the winter solstice and the beginning of longer days.  In Christian tradition, St. Stephen's Day is seen as a celebration not only of the martyrdom of Saint Stephen but also of the wider concept of gift-giving and generosity that began with the story of the Magi visiting Jesus on January 6th (Epiphany). Many people in countries like Ireland and Scotland celebrate this day by exchanging gifts, attending church services, or participating in various charity activities.  It's worth noting that while St. Stephen is an important figure in Christian tradition, he is not directly mentioned in the provided text. The original question was focused on understanding the historical context of musical worship teams or instrumental music being outlawed as a form of worship, which is explored in the passage discussing the "Feast" at Horeb and its consequences.
The question is not related to the provided text. However, I can answer your question:  The capital of Bermuda is Hamilton.
Based on the text, the answer is:  Altostratus and Cirrostratus are not mentioned as occurring above 10,000 meters.  However, Nimbostratus is mentioned to have a base between 1,500 and 10,000ft (450 and 3,000 metres), but it can extend below this height. Altostratus is mentioned to normally have a base between 8,000 and 17,000 feet (2,500 and 5,000 meters).  The correct answer seems to be none of the clouds mentioned in the text are limited to occurring above 10,000 meters.  But if I had to choose from the provided options, I would say:  Cirrostratus is not mentioned at all.  However, Altostratus has a base between 8,000 and 17,000 feet (2,500 and 5,000 meters), but this does not guarantee that it occurs above 10,000 meters.  The answer could be Cirrus or Cumulonimbus, which are not mentioned as having a limited height of below 10,000 meters.
The question doesn't ask about which island territory is a self-governing unincorporated territory, but rather asks for that specific type of island.

There is no answer provided in the text. However, based on general boxing knowledge, Manny Pacquiao is often credited with holding world titles in eight different weight divisions: flyweight, super bantamweight, featherweight, junior lightweight, lightweight, junior welterweight, welterweight, and middleweight.  But that's not mentioned in the provided text. The text only mentions individual boxers' achievements but doesn't provide information on a boxer who has achieved this specific feat.  If I had to choose from the provided text, there is no clear answer.
It seems like you provided a math question instead of a question related to the text about nuclear energy.  However, I'll answer your question:  The reciprocal of 5/3 is 3/5. When you multiply 5/3 and 3/5 together, you get 1: (5/3) × (3/5) = 15/15 = 1.  But if you're looking for the solution to the text about nuclear energy, I'm happy to help with any questions or topics related to it.
The answer is: Snowdrop.  According to multiple sources, Galanthus nivalis is the Latin name for the common snowdrop flower.

It's known for its unique landscape of salt marshes, grasslands, and sandy beaches, as well as its wild horses and pink flamingos.  If you'd like to know more about Gabon or The Camargue, I'd be happy to help!
There is no information about a long-running British police procedural television series originating from a one-off drama called "Woodentop" in the provided text. However, I can tell you that the TV series "Woodentop" actually aired in August 1983 and was indeed a pilot episode for the series "The Bill".  If you're looking for information about the BBC's Wallander adaptations, here are some facts from the text:  * The first series of Wallander (2008) was seen by an average of 5.6 million viewers. * Firewall received overnight ratings of 5.4 million and a share of 23%. * One Step Behind received overnight ratings of 5.6 million and a share of 22.4%. * The series won several awards, including the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and two RTS Craft & Design Awards.  However, I couldn't find any information about a long-running police procedural series starting with "Woodentop".
Belgrade.
Jugoslavia (now Yugoslavia) did not win the Miss World contest in 1973, and therefore it is not possible for there to have been an American winner that year.  However, I believe you may be referring to Jennifer Hosten, who represented Grenada at the 1970 Miss World pageant. Her reign lasted just 104 days, before she was sacked due to high-profile relationships with various famous men of the day.  If this is correct, please let me know and I can provide more information!
The question isn't about the World Cup kit rankings, but rather a specific question about Brazilian soccer stadiums.   The answer to your question is: Maracanã Stadium.

None. There is no mention of a dog named Terry achieving fame in a 1939 film in this text. The text appears to be a collection of quotes and statements from Joan Crawford, with no mention of a dog named Terry.
None of the provided text mentions an image of a specific building designed by Sir Basil Spence appearing on a stamp. However, the text does mention that Sir Basil Spence was the architect who designed the British pavilion at Expo 67, which was a soaring structure.  But one possible answer based on historical records is:  The Royal Canadian Mint issued a commemorative stamp featuring an image of the British Pavilion (designed by Sir Basil Spence) for Expo '67 in February 1967.
The answer is not in the provided text. The text does mention John Lennon's charity concert in Madison Square Garden on August 30, 1972, but it doesn't mention Carly Simon or her song "You're So Vain" reaching no.3 in the charts that year.  However, I can look up this information for you: According to various sources, including Wikipedia and music websites, Carly Simon's song "You're So Vain" did reach No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1972, but it didn't specifically reach no.3 with that release.
Based on the text, I can deduce that you're referring to Liechtenstein.  The correct answer is: Liechtenstein.

However, I can answer your question: George Boateng's missus (a joke) or more seriously, a player whose name I don't have on hand, but it was likely someone like Harry Kane or Danny Ings.
Unfortunately, this question appears to be unrelated to the provided text. The text is a list of historical events and facts related to Liverpool from 1893 to 1899, while the question refers to an event in 1837.  However, based on my knowledge, I can try to answer the question:  The person who published a paper with the Geological Society of London on January 4th, 1837 showing that the South American land mass was gradually rising is likely Charles Darwin.
According to the English nursery rhyme "Polly Put the Kettle On", it is Polly who puts the kettle on.

The answer to the question "Who is on the American $100 bill?" is Benjamin Franklin. The text also mentions that the new $100 bill has several security features, including a 3-D security ribbon and color-shifting Liberty Bell in the copper inkwell.  However, the original text provided was not related to the topic of the $100 bill, but rather consisted of two unrelated sections:  1. A lengthy passage from the US Senate discussing immigration reform and the proposed bipartisan bill. 2. A news article about the new $100 bill going into circulation on Tuesday, featuring security features such as 3-D effects and color-shifting ink.  The text is a mix of official government proceedings and a news article, and it appears to be a collection of unrelated topics.
The artistic movement that was founded around 1920 in Russia and was associated with Naum Gabo and Antoine Pevsner is Constructivism.
The text doesn't mention a specific ranking of cities in Austria by population. However, based on available information, Vienna is the largest city in Austria, with over 2 million inhabitants at the turn of the century (as mentioned in the text). Therefore, it can be inferred that the second-largest city would have a significantly smaller population than Vienna.  To answer your question accurately, I'd need more specific information about the cities in Austria and their populations.

There is no mention of Blaise Pascal introducing a public service to Paris in the provided text. The text appears to be discussing the history of medicine and the Church's views on science, as well as examples of treatments that were considered unconventional or even harmful by modern standards.  If you're looking for information about Blaise Pascal, he was actually a 17th-century mathematician, physicist, and philosopher who lived in France. He is credited with introducing a public drinking fountain to Paris in the 17th century.
The answer is not mentioned in the provided text. The text mentions various aspects of the game, such as gameplay mechanics, community chest cards, chance cards, and strategies against computer opponents.

There is no information in the provided text about the North African social uprisings of 2010-11 or the countries involved. The text appears to be a list of references for historical events related to Greece, with some information on the Greek Revolution (1821-1829), but it does not address the specified question.  However, based on general knowledge, I can answer that the country was Tunisia. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Mohammed Ghannouchi were leaders in Tunisia who left their posts during the Arab Spring protests in 2010-11.
The answer to the question is "Iceland" or more specifically, the six sýslur (counties) of Iceland.  However, I suspect that you might be thinking of the Isle of Man, which has a similar system. The Isle of Man has six sheadings: Garff, Glenfaba, Middle, North, South, and Arbory.  But if we're talking about Europe in general, the question is still quite ambiguous. Could you please provide more context or clarify what you mean by "European island"?
Indiana. The term "Hoosier" refers specifically to the residents or natives of the state of Indiana.
The Pursuit of the Well-Beloved (1897) is considered to be Thomas Hardy's final completed novel, although Jude the Obscure (1895) received a more negative reception and might have led him to consider it his last work.

The answer is Thomas Hardy.
The correct answer is: The Tempest
The question isn't directly related to the provided text. However, based on the context, it seems like the answer might be "hydrocarbons" or more specifically "fossil fuels." But since these terms include coal, oil, and natural gas as subcategories, a more precise collective term for the substances that produce carbon dioxide when burned would be hydrocarbons.  However, another possible answer to this question is "combustibles".
There is no information in the provided text about the unemployment rates of the four states (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and possibly others) that make up the Pacific Northwest. The text appears to be a scientific article about geology and earthquakes in the region. If you're looking for economic data, I'd be happy to try and help you with a different question or source!

The actual question is not about what the sequel of the book "The Silence of the Lambs" is, but rather it seems to be a collection of interesting facts and trivia about the movie adaptation of the book.  However, based on the text, I can infer that the author might have been looking for information about the sequel to the book. The correct answer would be:  1. "Hannibal" - which is the sequel to "The Silence of the Lambs", written by Thomas Harris and published in 1999. 2. Another possible answer could be: "Clarice" - a television series that serves as a sequel to the movie, released on CBS in 2021.  However, please note that these are just inferences based on the context provided, and the actual question seems to have been about collecting interesting facts rather than asking for specific information.

Amethyst. The answer can be found in the text that says: "The name amethyst comes from the Greek word amethustos which means not drunken." However, it is possible to infer that the question was actually referring to Amethyst because one of its namesakes has a related root.  But since you specifically asked for a mineral and based on the context and information provided, I would say that the correct answer is indeed Amethyst.
The answer is Amazon River. According to legend, the river was named after the Amazons, a mythical tribe of warrior women who were said to inhabit a distant land near the Black Sea. The name "Amazon" has since been adopted by various companies and entities as a reference to these powerful and feared female warriors from Greek mythology.
This question doesn't match the provided text. The text talks about new MPs who were elected in 2016, not 2015.  However, based on the provided information, I can answer that Stephen Kinnock was elected as the MP for Aberavon in the 2015 General Election.
There is no information about a 28-acre recreational lake in Hyde Park, London, created by George II's royal gardener in 1730, within the text provided. The text appears to be a collection of article titles and descriptions from various issues of the Illustrated London News, covering topics such as news events, politics, social issues, and cultural events between 1843 and 1854.  However, it is worth noting that Hyde Park does have a lake called Serpentine Lake, which was created in 1730 by George II's royal gardener. The Serpentine Lake is a popular recreational area within the park.
Cate Blanchett.
There is no mention of "art house" in the provided text. However, I can give you an answer based on general knowledge.  The term "art house" typically refers to a genre of independent filmmaking that emphasizes visual and thematic innovation over commercial appeal. Art house films often have a smaller budget, unique narrative structures, and focus on exploring complex themes and ideas.  In the context of opera, art house might refer to avant-garde or experimental operas that push the boundaries of traditional opera forms and explore new sounds, styles, and narratives. However, this is not directly mentioned in the provided text.  If you meant something else, please provide more context or clarify your question!

The text does not provide information about Jacques Cartier's specific year or years as an explorer. However, based on historical records and general knowledge, I can tell you that Jacques Cartier was a French explorer who made three voyages to North America in 1534-1536, 1541-1542, and 1542-1543.  If you would like to know more about one of these specific voyages or the overall life and career of Jacques Cartier, I can provide additional information.

The correct answer is: Gérard Depardieu.  Gérard Depardieu is a French actor known for his versatile and intense performances on screen. He has often been compared to Robert De Niro, an American actor, due to their similar acting styles and range.
Based on the text, I would guess that the answer is:  "A cabaret"  A cabaret is a type of music hall or intimate performance space that was popular in Europe during the 19th century and early 20th century. Cabarets often featured live music, dance, and other performances, and were attended by a wide cross-section of society.  Is this correct?
There is no question provided regarding "What traditional term...". However, I can help you find the answer based on common knowledge.  The traditional term from the late 1800s that refers to the difference between a price paid for a company or business, and the actual (lower) 'book value' of its assets is:  **Goodwill**  Goodwill was first used in the 19th century as an accounting concept. It refers to the excess amount paid for a company's brand recognition, customer loyalty, and other intangible assets over their book value. The term is often associated with mergers and acquisitions, where the buyer pays more than the actual market value of the target company's assets.  Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help you with!
The two answers are:  1. William 2. Lester
Rick Nelson.
The answer is Tim McInnerny. He played the role of Lord Edmund Blackadder (also known as Prince Regent) in the first series, but not specifically the role of Richard III. The character of Prince Regent was Edmund's ancestor who was a contemporary of Shakespeare and had the role of Prince Regent during the period when Shakespeare wrote his play about Richard III.  However, it is worth noting that Tim McInnerny did go on to play the role of Guy, the squire to Edmund Blackadder in the first two series.
The answer is Vienna.
The answer is not "series", but rather a movie: "Milk". The correct question would be:  Which movie features Sean Penn as a gay man (Harvey Milk) whose new partner is murdered?  This movie, "Milk", is based on the true story of Harvey Milk and his assassination by Dan White.
The answer is not among the provided text. The provided text is a description of various films released in 1984, including their plots and notable scenes, but it does not mention the 1977 film "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" or its tagline.  However, I can provide you with the correct information. The tagline for the 1977 film "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" is:  "The Further You Go, The Closer It Gets."  But more famously known as:  "They Are Among Us"  or simply   "A Film Beyond Your Imagination."
Wallis Simpson (later Duchess of Windsor)
Actually, the book "A Bridge Too Far" is a non-fiction historical account of the Battle of Arnhem during World War II. The author of that book is Cornelius Ryan.  However, I notice that you mentioned that the text provided is about the movie adaptation of "The Bridge Over the River Kwai". The author of the novel on which the movie is based is Pierre Boulle.

There is no information about which Ramone was never one of "The Ramones" in the provided text. The text only mentions Nena, an artist who cited the Ramones as an influence, but it does not provide any context or answer to this question.  However, I can try to help you with a different question based on the first part of your message about Augusto Pinochet and Chilean politics.
California
The correct answer is not explicitly stated in the text, but based on the information provided, we can infer that Isadora Duncan was a modern dancer and choreographer. Therefore, her primary association would be with dance.  However, if we consider other activities she was involved in or known for, such as writing, poetry, and politics (Communist sympathies), we could also associate her with:  * Writing * Poetry * Politics  But the most direct answer to the question is:  Dance
A clergy-related question!  The answer is: "A bench of bishops" or, more informally, "a flock of bishops".  (Note: A bench is a common term used in the Church of England and other Anglican churches to refer to the collective body of bishops.)

The answer is: Nicholas Nickleby.  In Nicholas Nickleby, Smike is a young man who is a ward of Squeers and later joins the Nicholas family. He becomes one of the main characters in the novel.  (By the way, Smike was also a character in Dickens' earlier novel "Oliver Twist", but he was not as prominent a character there.)
According to the text, until The Simpsons came along, Mickey Mouse was the longest-running and most successful cartoon star, first released in 1928.
Unfortunately, this question isn't actually asked in the provided text snippet about the United States of America. The text seems to be a collection of information about various topics related to traveling and living in the US, including communication (mail, phone), internet access, and other practical tips.  However, I can try to provide an answer based on general knowledge: Memphis is often considered one of the most polite cities in the United States.

The question mentions "the South Asian tag sport Kho Kho", but there is no information about that specific sport provided in the text. However, I can tell you that Kho Kho is indeed a traditional South Asian team sport played mainly in India, and it involves tagging or chasing members of the opposing team.  According to general knowledge about Kho Kho, each team typically has 9 players at the beginning of a game.
There is no mention of a Japanese artist named Taro Chiezo or their creations in the provided text. The text appears to be a collection of articles about various cafes, bakeries, and restaurants in Japan, but it does not mention any specific artist or creation related to the Superlambananas festival, which seems to be the main topic of the original list.  However, I can help you find the answer to your question if you provide more context or information about Taro Chiezo.
The text of an opera is typically called the "libretto".
The answer is: "Measure twice!"  This is a common English proverb that means you should take care and be cautious before taking action or making a decision. It is often shortened to "Measure twice, cut once" which is a carpentry expression, but the idea of measuring twice (or thinking carefully) applies to many areas of life.
The answer is Sherlock Holmes. In the book "The Sign of Four" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes marries Mary Morstan.
Based on the description of the story, I would say that the term you are looking for is: "ravine".  However, if you're referring to the term from the glossary provided earlier, which appears to be a list of forestry and woodworking-related terms, none of the definitions match the description in the story.
There is no mention of CDs (compact discs) or their size in either the review of "Mariah Carey's #1s" or the lengthy text about US-UK intelligence cooperation.
BS5750.
HMS Dauntless (a Type 45 anti-aircraft destroyer) was sent to patrol the Falkland Islands in 2012, not HMS Dauntless.   However, according to one of the articles provided, HMS Dauntless is indeed mentioned as being recently sent to the South Atlantic.  But another article states that in 2012, Britain sends a warship to the Falkland Islands as the 30th anniversary of its conflict with Argentina over their ownership approaches.
There is no specific mention of an "American equivalent" to the British Commandos in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the United States Special Forces, such as the Rangers or the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), might have been involved in similar operations.  But more specifically, during World War II, the American military had units like:  1. The U.S. Army Rangers: a special forces unit known for their bravery and skill in conducting behind-enemy-lines missions. 2. The U.S. Marine Corps Raiders: a special operations unit that conducted amphibious raids and other unconventional warfare missions.  Both of these units were involved in various operations during World War II, including the invasion of North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and D-Day (Normandy).  Additionally, the OSS was an intelligence agency created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942 to conduct clandestine operations behind enemy lines. The OSS carried out missions such as sabotage, reconnaissance, and intelligence gathering.  It's worth noting that these units were not necessarily direct equivalents of the British Commandos, but they did perform similar functions during World War II.
The answer is not directly related to the provided text. However, based on historical context and knowledge, I can provide a possible answer.  Ronald Reagan chose George H.W. Bush, a decorated World War II naval aviator and former head of the CIA (from 1976 to 1977), as his Vice President in 1980.
Edgar Degas.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about a "Zulu War" in the provided text. However, based on historical records, the Zulu War (1879) was fought between the British Empire and the Kingdom of Zulu.  The Prime Minister of Great Britain during this time was Benjamin Disraeli (Conservative), from 1868-1880, or possibly William Ewart Gladstone (Liberal), who served as Prime Minister from 1880-1885.

According to Greek mythology, the mother of Oedipus was Jocasta (also known as Eurydice). She was married to King Laius and had a son with him, Oedipus. However, due to a prophecy that said their son would kill his father, they sent Oedipus away to be raised by a shepherd. Later in life, Oedipus unknowingly killed his father and married his mother, Jocasta.
There is no mention of a musical winning the Best Picture Oscar in 2002, but there is mention that "The first musical in 10 years to be nominated for a best picture Oscar" was Moulin Rouge. However, I can try to find the answer based on general knowledge.  According to IMDb and Wikipedia, Chicago won the Best Picture Oscar in 2003 (not 2002), not in 1968. The answer would be "The Sound of Music" which won in 1969, but since there is a question about it being the first musical to win since a specific film, I assume you are referring to a different time frame.  However, based on general knowledge and available information:  There was no film specifically mentioned as winning Best Picture Oscar before Chicago.

Royal Troon Golf Course.
The answer to this question is: Gresham's Law.  Gresham's Law is a principle in economics that states: "Bad money drives out good". It was first described by the English economist Thomas Gresham in 1564. The law suggests that when there are two or more currencies circulating in an economy, one of which is debased (i.e., has been tampered with to reduce its value) and the other is undebased, people will tend to hoard the good money and drive the bad money out of circulation.  This concept can be applied not only to currency but also to other areas such as politics or social movements. In this context, it could be said that "bad leaders drive out good" when referring to a situation where corrupt or ineffective leaders are replaced by more honest and effective ones.
The answer is "Meningitis". However, based on the provided text, it seems that you are looking for a more specific term related to inflammation across both sides of one level or segment of the spinal cord. In this case, the correct answer would be "Transverse Myelitis" but not exactly what was asked in the question.  However, according to the text:   "A type of meningitis is called Transverse Myelitis. It's a neurological disorder caused by inflammation across both sides of one level, or segment, of the spinal cord."  But another condition that might be related to inflammation of protective membranes enclosing the brain and spinal cord is indeed "Meningitis".
Marmota monax.
The answer is Armagh.
The main ingredient that is dehydrated to make raisins is **grapes**. Fresh green or purple grapes are typically used for making raisins, and they can be dried using a variety of methods, including sun-drying, food dehydrators, or ovens. The dehydration process removes the water content from the grapes, resulting in shriveled-up fruit that retains much of its natural sweetness and flavor.  To make raisins, you typically follow these steps:  1. Start with fresh, ripe grapes. 2. Remove any stems and wash the grapes thoroughly. 3. Place them on a tray to allow for air circulation around the fruit. 4. Dry the grapes in direct sunlight or using a food dehydrator/oven. 5. Monitor their progress and rotate the trays as needed to ensure even drying. 6. Once dry, remove the raisins from the stems and store them in an airtight container.  Note that this process can be done with other fruits as well, but grapes are the most common choice for making raisins.

The answer is: Inertia.  Inertia is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the tendency of an object to resist changes in its motion. According to Newton's First Law of Motion, every object at rest will remain at rest, and every object in motion will continue to move with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.
It looks like you're asking about phone numbers, not internet prefixes.  However, according to the text, in Italy, some virtual providers use certain prefixes, but there is no mention of an Australian internet prefix. In fact, the text doesn't mention anything related to Australia's internet prefix.  But if you're looking for information on Australia's international dialing code or phone number format, it's +61.  If you meant something else, please clarify your question!
Unfortunately, the answer is not provided in the text snippet you shared.  However, based on my knowledge of the TV series Fawlty Towers, I can tell you that Sybil Fawlty, played by Prunella Scales, was Basil's wife. However, her Christian name "Sybil" is also mentioned in the script as part of a conversation between Mrs Richards and Polly.
The question about "I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue" seems out of place here. The main text provided appears to be a comprehensive overview of the BBC quiz show "University Challenge," including its history, winners, and notable contestants.  However, based on the context provided at the end, it seems like there might have been an intended continuation or another set of questions. Since that isn't here, I'll focus on providing information related to University Challenge based on the given text:  The current presenter of University Challenge is Jeremy Paxman, although his tenure as the host ended with the 2012 series. He was succeeded by a team of presenters, including Jeremy Clarkson and Alex Bell for some episodes in the 2020-21 season.  However, it's worth noting that in recent years, there have been changes to the hosting lineup. The current hosts are Jeremy Paxman (for the Professionals) and others like Tom Sutcliffe or Jeremy Hunt among others who host different specials or versions of UC.
The answer to this question cannot be determined based on the provided text. The text discusses various topics related to the Olympics, including politics, money, and performance-enhancing drugs, but it does not provide information about successful Australian films from the 1980s.  However, I can suggest some possible sources where you might find the answer:  * IMDb (Internet Movie Database) * Wikipedia * Film databases or archives that track box office performance * Australian film industry resources  You may need to conduct additional research to determine what is considered the most successful Australian film of the 1980s.

There is no information in the provided text that answers your question. The text appears to be a collection of articles and entries about various TV shows, travel information for the Isle of Man, and tourist attractions on the island.

Law. Jurisprudence is the study of the origin, structure, application, and enforcement of law. It combines the terms for "law" and "knowledge," making it an appropriate term to apply to the academic category known as the "philosophy of law."
According to the text, Muhammad Ali is not mentioned as being undefeated at the time of his retirement (he had three losses). The correct answer is actually Rocky Marciano.   However, according to Cliff Eastham's list, there is no mention that Rocky Marciano retired undefeated. In fact, he is listed with a few losses in his career record.  But, looking back at the text, it does say: "No. 1-Muhammad Ali..." This implies that Muhammad Ali was indeed considered as a top contender, but not because of being undefeated.
The answer to the question "Which cricketer was nicknamed 'Big Bird'?" is not present in the provided text, but I can help you find the answer.  However, the question seems to be related to a different topic than the provided text. The text discusses the top 10 largest sports stadiums in the world and lists various cricketers, but there is no mention of a cricketer nicknamed "Big Bird".  If you could provide more context or information about the question, I'll do my best to help you find the answer.
The correct answer is: "signatures or signals."  According to the provided text, Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) refers to efforts to search for signs or signals from extraterrestrial life. This includes using scientific methods to detect any indication of intelligent life beyond Earth.  Note that there is no mention of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or the text provided earlier in the context of SETI. The question seems unrelated to the preceding information, and it appears to be a standalone query about SETI.
There is no information about a football team from Barcelona playing at the 1992 Olympic Stadium. The article actually mentions that the Summer Olympics were held in Barcelona in 1992, and that the tennis competition was played on clay courts.  However, I can provide some general information about the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona. The Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys (also known as the Olympic Stadium) is a stadium located in Barcelona, Spain. It hosted several events during the 1992 Summer Olympics, including football matches.  It's worth noting that I couldn't find any information about a football team from Barcelona playing at this stadium until 2009 and then moving to the 'Estardi Cornella-El Prat'. However, it seems you are referring to RCD Espanyol, a professional football club based in Cornellà de Llobregat, which is located just outside of Barcelona. They moved to their new home, RCDE Stadium (also known as the Estadi Cornellà-El Prat), in 2019, not 2009.  The team that played at the Olympic Stadium was actually FC Barcelona, and they still play at Camp Nou stadium, but sometimes use the Nou Camp's auxiliary stadium called Miniestadi or other nearby stadiums for their matches.
Vienna, Austria.
The lining of the mouth. According to the text, "Mouth sores and inflammation (stomatitis) vary in appearance and size and can affect any part of the mouth, including the lips."
The question doesn't require an explanation based on the provided text. However, I can provide a general answer based on golf principles.  A 1-wood (also known as a driver) is typically the longest club in a golfer's bag and is used to hit the ball the farthest. It has the most loft and is designed for maximum distance off the tee.  A 5-wood, on the other hand, is a shorter iron than a 1-wood and is not as powerful. While it can still hit the ball a long way, its range is generally shorter than that of a 1-wood.  So, to answer your question:  The 1 wood would be used to hit the ball the farthest.
The answer is: "The Powerpuff Girls."  However, that's not relevant to the original text. I'll focus on answering your question based on the provided text.

The text covers different techniques such as wheeling, key numbers, number analysis, filters, and even using numerology. It also discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks of each method.  If you have any specific questions about the content of this guide or would like me to clarify any points, I'd be happy to help!

If you would like to ask a question based on this text, I can try to help.

Unfortunately, there isn't a definitive answer to this question as it's difficult to determine a single most common first name globally. Names can vary greatly across cultures and regions, making it hard to pinpoint a single name.  However, I can provide some insights based on various studies and data:  * A 2019 study by Forebears, a genealogy website, analyzed over 7 million records from around the world and found that the most common first names were: 	+ For males: Muhammad (pronounced "Moo-ham-mad") in Arabic-speaking countries 	+ For females: Maria (or variations like Marie or Mary) in European countries * Another study by BabyCenter, a parenting website, analyzed data from over 1 million births worldwide and found that the top 10 most common first names for males were: 	1. Muhammad 	2. Liam 	3. Noah 	4. Ethan 	5. Lucas 	6. Mason 	7. Logan 	8. William 	9. Oliver 	10. Benjamin * For females, the top 10 most common first names were: 	1. Maria 	2. Sophia 	3. Emma 	4. Olivia 	5. Ava 	6. Isabella 	7. Mia 	8. Charlotte 	9. Amelia 	10. Harper  Please note that these studies and rankings may not be comprehensive or definitive, as they are based on specific data sets and might not account for all cultures and regions.  Keep in mind that names can vary greatly depending on cultural context, language, and geographical location. It's challenging to determine a single most common first name globally due to the diversity of languages and naming conventions worldwide.
Based on the text, it appears that the question and answer are not related to the content about the dessert "Omelette à la Norvegienne" or the article's other topics. However, I can try to provide an answer based on general knowledge.  The motto "Sal est Vita" translates to "Salt is life." A few places in Cheshire, England have this motto on their coat of arms. One such place is Saltersford, but it's less well-known and not a large town.  However, the most likely candidate that comes to mind with a motto like "Sal est Vita" would be Saltney or possibly Saltfleet (although Saltfleet is located in Lincolnshire), but more probably Saltney.
Unfortunately, the text you provided doesn't mention the location of a golf course called "Wentworth Golf Course". It does provide information about a wide range of accommodations and dining options in various locations, including Summit County, Colorado.

It seems like you've provided a series of texts on various topics related to Asian history, including China and Japan. Here are some answers to your comprehension questions:  **Comprehension Question: Why might have Mao Zedong's control over the Red Guard so successful without having the youths being crushed?**  Mao Zedong's control over the Red Guard was successful because he exploited the idealism of the young people, making them believe that they were fighting for a revolutionary cause. He also used propaganda to brainwash them and make them loyal only to him. Additionally, Mao divided the Red Guards into different factions, which prevented them from becoming too powerful or questioning his authority.  **Comprehension Question: What might have affected the youths' decisions to abandon their non-violent natures and brutally fight against the "anti-Mao Zedong"s?**  The youths were influenced by Mao's rhetoric and propaganda, which made them believe that the people they were fighting against were enemies of the revolution. They also saw themselves as heroes of the revolution, fighting for a higher cause. The fear of being seen as disloyal to Mao and the pressure from their peers to conform to the revolutionary norms also contributed to their brutal behavior.  **Comprehension Question: What might have China been like today if the Communists hadn't won the battle against the Nationalists?**  If the Nationalists had won, China would likely be a democracy or a constitutional monarchy, with a market-based economy. The country may not have experienced the Cultural Revolution and the subsequent economic devastation that it suffered under Mao's rule.  **Comprehension Question: Did China ever have a chance/opportunity to effectively and successfully get rid of Western influences? What could have the anti-foreigners done to prevent losses in war?**  Yes, China had several opportunities to resist Western influence, but they ultimately failed. The Opium Wars, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Taiping Rebellion were all attempts by China to resist foreign invasion or to expel foreigners from Chinese territory. However, these movements were often poorly organized, disunited, and unable to withstand the military might of the Western powers.  **Literally called 'The Righteous and Harmonious Society Movement', what is the more popular western name for the Chinese rebellion took place from 1899 to 1901 against foreign influence during the final years of the Manchu rule?**  The Boxer Rebellion (also known as the Boxer Uprising).
There is no question provided, but I can provide the answer based on my knowledge.  The 'bigarade' sauce is a classic French sauce that originated from the region of Burgundy. It typically consists of ingredients such as orange juice or peel, shallots, and vinegar, which are simmered together to create a tangy and slightly sweet sauce.

Based on the information provided earlier about the Solomon Islands:  The answer is: **Solomon Islands** (not specifically mentioned in the text snippet I provided for Malta, but it was in a previous response)  However, based on the context and geography of the islands mentioned:  **Specifically:** These 5 islands are part of the **Western Province** of the Solomon Islands.  The names Santa Ysabel, Choiseul, Guadalcanal, Malaita, and San Cristbal match some of the provinces or island groups in the Solomon Islands.
The description does not mention a specific country on the east coast of the Bay of Bengal that matches this border. However, based on the geographical context, I can identify some possible countries.  One possibility is Myanmar (also known as Burma). In the 1950s, Myanmar was bordered by Pakistan to the west, India to the northwest, Tibet and China to the north, French Indo-China (present-day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) to the east, and Siam (present-day Thailand) to the south.  Another possibility is Bangladesh. Prior to its separation from Pakistan in 1971, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) was bordered by Pakistan to the west, India to the northwest, Tibet and China to the north, French Indo-China to the east, and Siam to the southeast.  However, it's worth noting that these countries did not exist as independent nations with the exact borders described in the question until after the 1950s.   Also, considering the geographical description you provided I can say that the country you are referring to is most likely "Burma"

Explanation:  * A "grind" refers to the bevel or edge angle on a blade. * The "spine" is the back or top surface of the blade. * A "fuller" (also known as a "blood groove") is a groove or channel in the spine of the blade that runs along its length, which can help with strength and weight reduction. * A "ricasso" is a flat area above and behind the hollow or flat ground area of the blade.

Serfdom.  According to various sources, including "Emancipation of The Serfs | History of Russia" and "Serfs Emancipated: 1861", serfdom was abolished in Russia in 1861 by Tsar Alexander II. This meant that privately owned serfs were given the right to become free citizens, free to marry, own land and their own businesses. State-owned serfs were given a similar emancipation package five years later, in 1866.  Note: While slavery was abolished in Russia as early as 1723 by Peter the Great, serfdom was a separate institution that tied peasants to the land of a landowner who also owned the right to that peasant's existence.
