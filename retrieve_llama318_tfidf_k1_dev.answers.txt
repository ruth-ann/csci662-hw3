Thomas Lipton (or Lord Thomas Lipton) is not mentioned, but the correct answer is:  Sir Thomas Lipton was not the one trying to win back the America's Cup from the New York Yacht Club 5 times between 1899 and 1930. However, Sir Thomas Lipton did try four times to win the America's Cup.  The correct answer is: Sir Thomas Lipton's arch-rival in the America's Cup was:  Sir Thomas's arch-nemesis on the seas... was not present in the provided text either. However I think I have it now! Sir Thomas Lipton was indeed trying to beat the American yachts for years but he did this 6 times with his four Shamrocks, three others plus a fifth boat but only once sailed by him personally.  So, I am going to answer: Sir THOMAS LIPTON

True.  The quote "Something wicked this way comes" is from Act 4, Scene 1 of William Shakespeare's play Macbeth:   "Act I, Scene i  When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions; First, her husband; then the men she married; Thirdly, a son; and he hath murders Virtuous and well-graduated are the people of this land, Lovers that have mischief in their mouths Evil souls, full of dead minutes; Time is like a fashionable host That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand  And say 'Good morrow,' till it be 'good night',  Then he cracks you his witty commiserations - There's nothing serious in him. Say that the play is the tragedy all the world keeps itself away." But then in Act 4 Scene 1 of Macbeth  "Act IV, Sc. i When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions: First her husband, then the men she married, Thirdly a son, and he murders  Who is it?  The first that ever scorned me. And now  A slave! The second time.  By th' Lord, this cannot be;  Something wicked this way comes."

The correct answer is:  **False**  According to the text, the common Christmas decorations seen in German homes that are said to be the predecessors of the modern Christmas tree are a "pyramidal" structure, but specifically, they take the form of a **triangle-shaped** pyramid called the "Paradiesbaum", and later, a decorated fir cone known as the "Paradiesbaum auf dem Tannenast" (also triangular in shape), but also sometimes referred to as the predecessors for Christmas trees.  So, according to this description, it's more accurate to say that these Christmas decorations are triangular or pyramidal rather than being a perfect triangle.

This question requires a numerical answer. I will provide the correct solution and indicate whether it's True or False.  The original statement "What is the reciprocal of one-and-two-thirds (in other words, what fraction when multiplied by one-and-two-thirds produces one)?" asks for the multiplicative inverse of 1 2/3.   To find the reciprocal of a mixed number, we can convert it to an improper fraction:   1 2/3 = (3 + 2)/3 = 5/3   The reciprocal of 5/3 is the fraction that results in one when multiplied by 5/3. To calculate this, we flip the fraction and then multiply:    (5/3) × (3/5) = (5 × 3)/(3 × 5) = 15/15 = 1   The multiplicative inverse of a number is the value that produces one when multiplied by it. In this case, the reciprocal of 5/3 is indeed 3/5.   So, True

The correct answer is: True.  According to the text:  "In the ancient world if Vedic religion was enmeshed in the caste based limitations of its own creation, Buddhism and Jainism broke through all barriers and reached out to a cross section of society to teach them the secrets of salvation that were hitherto kept hidden from them. They used Prakrit, the language of the common people, rather than Sanskrit, for the propagation of their respective doctrines."

The correct answer is:  **False**  The actual proverb "Before you leap, look well as far as you can. Trifle not; act wisely." isn't present in the list of proverbs provided, but another related one says: "He who leaps high must take a long run." This suggests that before taking action (leaping), one should prepare thoroughly and consider the consequences.

The answer is True.  Several US Presidents have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, including:  * Theodore Roosevelt (1906) * Woodrow Wilson (1919) * Jimmy Carter (2002) - although he was not a sitting president when awarded * Barack Obama (2009)  However, one President who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize after his term in office is:  * Theodore Roosevelt (1906), but I think you might be referring to another one: * Woodrow Wilson was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize immediately after his term in office. He was awarded it in 1919, three years after the end of World War I. * A more likely candidate would be: Jimmy Carter's award was announced in 2002 and he was a private citizen at that time.  It seems like one President who fits your question is:  * Barack Obama (2009)
