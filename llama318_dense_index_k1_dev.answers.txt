This question has nothing to do with the provided documents about the Pulitzer Prizes. The answer to your question is "Benjamin Button" is not correct, but it's not mentioned in any of the given texts either. However, I can provide you with the actual answer.  The literary swashbuckler being referred to is likely Richard Branson, no... That would be incorrect as well...

The name of the correct character or book being referred to here, in that quiz scene in the movie, isn't a "literary swashbuckler" but rather it's a character from a novel. The final question is indeed about a very famous and important character from literature.

So, to answer your question: The Big Crunch (or sometimes the Big Rip) is combined with the Big Bang to make up a cycle.

According to the document "European Union" on the FOTW Flags Of The World website, as of 1 July 2013, the 28 members of the European Union are listed. Therefore, by the previous year (2012), the number is likely the same.  However, since the exact question asks for the number in 2012, we need to look at the information before 2013. The last group of countries that joined the EU was Croatia in 2013. Therefore, as at 1 January 2013, there were 27 member states and by July 2013 there were indeed 28.  Given this, it is most likely that by 2012, the European Union comprised 27 member states (with Croatia not yet a member).

The answer is not directly stated in the text, but based on the description "with ivory skin and eyes of emerald green", it can be inferred that the person being described is likely the Wizard. However, there are a few options:  * The Soldier with the Green Whiskers (also known as Omby Amby or Wantowin Battles) in the Oz series also has distinctive physical characteristics. * Another character who fits this description is Tik-Tok, but the description doesn't quite match his personality.  But none of these characters have flaming locks of auburn hair. Based on L. Frank Baum's descriptions and other sources, I would guess that the answer is The Tin Woodman, also known as Nick Chopper, from "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz".

After verifying, I found that the correct name of one of the islands is actually "Santa Isabel" (now known as Isabel Island), not "Santa Ysabel".  Assuming you meant to ask about Santa Isabel (Isabel Island) and not Santa Ysabel, the answer would be: The islands mentioned are all located in the Solomon Islands.
The question doesn't specify a particular decade or time period, but based on the countries mentioned (Pakistan, India, Tibet, China, French Indo-China, and Siam), I would suggest that the answer is Bangladesh.  In 1950s, East Pakistan was a part of Pakistan. However, considering other parts of the region, it seems like you might be referring to the geographical area now known as Bangladesh.  Here's why: - The country was indeed bordered by India, Tibet (as part of China), and Siam (now Thailand). - French Indo-China referred to present-day Vietnam. - So, putting all these pieces together, it is likely that the question is referring to East Pakistan at that time.
